This means I can use it to clean the entire interior of my car, saving time and effort by not needing multiple products.The convenience of the foaming formula cannot be overstated. It clings to surfaces, allowing the active ingredients to work their magic without dripping or running.

3M Foaming Car Interior Cleaner (580 g) | Upholstery & Leather cleaner | Removes tough stains & dirt inside your car,"4.0 out of 5 stars
Nice product, but not enough",4.0,"This is really good product for cleaning interior of car. But there two negatives.One there is strong smell of chemical and fumes. So keep all car windows and dicky open and do it in open area. Also keep you face away from spray by extending your hand while spraying foam.Secondly, quantity is not enough for complete car cleaning of one car if you want to do seats, dashboard, door panels and roof. You will have to compromise one one or two things from above list as the quantity is less. One big size SUV for light cleaning, one and spray is needed and for deep cleaning two or even 2.5 cans are needed.But the product is worth it, so you can go for it. Also buy a light brush or use old toothbrush and microfiber cloth (2-3  are needed as one gets wet and dirty).Keep windows open while driving after your cleaning.

Doesn't work wonders. It's good, not great.",3.0,"I tried the product on Yoga mat, sofa, carpet, shoes, shoe sole (the white sole of some leather shoes).Good thing - none of the objects spoiled.Bad thing - the product failed to impress with its cleaning properties.The product was easy to apply. Dont shy away from fully depressing the nozzle. The can takes long to empty . But the cleaning that was provided with so much of foam was not satisfactory. Shoe soles were still dirty, though not as much as before. Yoga mat still had stains of sweat, even after using brush to remove dirt.My toddler vomited on sofa, which I cleaned with this foam. thankfully, there were no stains. But the foam's fragrance came to rescue.Overall, it's a mixed bag of experiences, more towards unsatisfactory.

Proklear RAW Xtreme CRC SIO2 Hybrid Ceramic Waterless Wash Concentrate Makes 50 liters - 250ml Pack,"5.0 out of 5 stars
Best Indian waterless/rinseless wash concentrate",5.0,"As a car detailing addict that is always in search of the best performing products; it is my humble opinion that the Proklear waterless/rinseless wash is the best in India. Price/cost effectiveness/performance; it is a winner in every way. There are 3 versions of the Proklear waterless/rinseless range and all are usually available on Amazon:1) RAW: this one is a pure wash concentrate with no added waxes/sealants for shine/protection; it will give you great lubrication/cleaning and that's it; you'll have to take care of the shine/protection aspect yourself.2) RAW Xtreme CX: has added carnauba wax for a beautiful natural wax shine and some protection until the next wash. Many people don't like ceramic products on their car and prefer the natural warm wax shine; this is for them.3) RAW Xtreme CRC: this is the one we're reviewing here; the newest variant and has ceramic/SiO2 polymers plus the carnauba wax; recommended for ceramic coated cars but can be used on any car, coated or not. My favourite variant because of the added benefits of ceramic/SiO2 technology; also the costliest.All 3 are great and I'm happy to use any of them; the pure RAW variant is half the price of the other two but also requires double the dosage (10ml concentrate per litre of water whereas the other two are 5ml per litre); so no real difference price wise; whether or not you want the added wax/ceramic protection will be the deciding factor in your choice. All 3 variants have the same lovely, mild and soothing scent; not too strong like many other detailing products. Except for fabric seats/carpets, you can use these gentle pH neutral products to safely clean all surfaces of the car, interior/exterior; but you'll need stronger cleaners for very dirty/muddy/greasy interiors/wheels/engine bay.For ceramic coated cars, any/all waterless/rinseless wash products are completely safe to use; the Xtreme CX variant has carnauba wax in it which is not really needed but also not harmful for a ceramic coated car; so you can either get the RAW version or this RAW Xtreme CRC, which is especially for ceramic coated cars.I switched to rinseless washing 5 years ago and have been fully convinced/converted with regard to its safety as a method of car washing. Please note this review is about rinseless washing and not waterless washing; two completely different methods. I'm still not convinced about waterless washing and feel it is a high risk method which is only for lightly dusty cars and for experienced detailers who know the secrets of waterless washing in and out; there are no lightly dusty cars in India and most of the people reading this are not experienced detailers; I would suggest that average users completely avoid this method; if you don't really care about your paint to that high level and just want the car clean without using buckets/water, then sure, go for it and the rest of this review will be a waste of your time; I've already said that this product is your best option even for a waterless wash. But if you're interested in protecting your paint while washing; keep reading.Unfortunately, I'm seeing a lot of misinformation/wrong techniques, both among the users and manufacturers. The Proklear product is excellent but I'm sorry to say that their video demonstration is pretty wrong; it bothers me to think how many people are washing their cars like that and unknowingly scratching their paint in the long run.We won't waste time talking about how others are doing it wrong; I'll just share a few tricks/methods which will help you master the art (yes, it's an art) of doing a safe rinseless wash using the least amount of water and with an end result which looks as good as or even better than a pressure wash. It's also important to remember that it's impossible to touch car paint without scratching; the washing/drying processes both will cause microscopic scratches which build up over time and become more visible to the eye; these tiny scratches are called 'love marks' in the detailing world because they happen when you're washing/loving/taking care of your car; the real goal of good wash techniques is to MINIMISE scratches; it's impossible to prevent them 100% even with the best technique.NEVER dust/wipe a dry car; throw away your Jopasu duster/any other duster and never again touch your car when it's dry. You are literally grinding/rubbing the dry dirt into your delicate paint. If you learn only one thing from this review, let it be this one. It's sad to see people dry dusting their car. Leave your car dirty/dusty until you get time to wash it properly and safely; just don't dry clean it, pleaseü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èTHE MULTIPLE TOWEL METHOD; also known as the Gary Dean method; a well known American detailer who thought of this brilliant technique as I'll explain below:1) You CANNOT wash a car safely without scratches using just 1-2 towels as shown in many videos. You'll never see a manufacturer video where they wash the whole car with the same 1-2 towels; they only work on one or two body panels for the video demo.But you CAN achieve a great safe wash with:a) 4-5 microfibre wash towels for the paint/bodyb) 2 dedicated wheel/tyre towels which should NEVER be used on the paintc) 1 specialised drying toweld) 1 dry towel for final buffing to activate the wax/ceramic shineThe trick is to fold each wash towel twice so that you end up with 8 square sides in each towel. Place the folded towels in your bucket and fill it with enough water to get the towels wet/underwater.2) Now, the important part; you already promised to not touch your car when dry; if you don't have a spray bottle lying around in the house, you can buy a good 1 litre spray bottle for around Rs.100/- on Amazon or in the shops; or just use a big empty Coke/Pepsi bottle and buy only the spray trigger heads to fit onto the bottle. I prefer buying the trigger heads because that's what usually breaks and not the bottle; it's good to have a set of triggers in stock and just replace them when they break. If you want an even better but more costly option, get yourself a 2 litre pump sprayer which will save you the time/effort of repeatedly pressing the spray trigger. I'll list some good/affordable options for all these products at the end of the review so don't think about that for now.Fill your bottle/sprayer with water; add 5ml of the Proklear concentrate per one litre of water and shake it up well. Generously spray the wash solution over the whole car; don't be cheap with it; all the brands say you can clean a car with 500 ml of their solution but in my experience, that's too less. Use the full 1 litre bottle and get the car as soaked/wet as possible; waterless/rinseless polymer technology works by lifting/enveloping the dirt and holding it in a lubricated layer above the paint surface to be cleaned off during washing; so you need to have enough solution on the car to lubricate the dirt on the paint. Hold the bottle close to the car; the spray force helps to rinse away loose dirt before you even touch the car. This is especially helpful for the lower body, which tends to be the dirtiest.3) With the car wet, take a folded wash towel from the bucket you prepared earlier; lightly squeeze most of the water back into the bucket but the towel should still be dripping wet. Using one side of the towel, clean only half a body panel; for example, half the roof or bonnet. Flip to a fresh side of the towel and clean the other half. Flip again and give the full panel one final wipe to pick up any remaining dirt. That last side used for the final wipe will still be clean so re-use it to clean another area such as the glass/plastics. The aim/logic is to work clean, work efficiently and to keep changing to a fresh side of the towel as you work your way around the car. Once you use up all 8 clean sides, set aside the dirty towel, take a fresh one from your bucket and continue. Do not rub the towel hard into the paint; gently wipe each panel in long straight lines and never in circles. Do not use any pressure; lightly guide the folded towel under your palm and let the wet weight of the towel do the work. For the front, sides and back of the car, wash from top to bottom because the lower areas are the dirtiest, as mentioned earlier. Clean the door/trunk jambs at the same time as the doors/trunk. This way you can just dry them later along with the rest of the car.4) With the car washed/clean, now comes the drying stage and the steps below are just as important to prevent scratches as the steps we had in the wash stage. Your drying towel also should be slightly damp before you start drying with it; microfibre just works better that way. You can either dip it in the remaining water from your clean towel bucket and then wring it as dry as you can; or spray it generously with your wash solution, whichever method you prefer. As an extra optional step, lightly spray some solution again on each panel before you start drying, for added lubrication. Fold the drying towel twice or thrice into a nice thick pad and gently wipe the car in one direction, in straight lines and never in circles. Do not rub the towel hard into the paint; no pressure; lightly guide it under your palm and let its weight do the work. Keep flipping to a fresh side as it gets wetter. If you're using a smaller towel, keep wringing the water out as you work your way around the car. Blow with your mouth into the tight areas like door handles/mirrors/corners to remove the water that usually collects there; your lungs will get a good workout too. If you don't have another drying towel only for glass, then dry the glass first before the body; you will have less streaks/smears on the glass that way. Once dry, GENTLY buff/wipe the whole car with the dry buffing towel to remove the wax/ceramic residue and activate the shine. You can skip this last step if in a hurry or if using a pure wash concentrate with no added wax/sealant.5) Great, so your car is clean/dry; but we still have the remaining water in the bucket and also those 2 folded wheel/tyre towels in it. I wonder what we could do with them; ah yes, we could clean the wheels! Clean the wheel first and then its tyre; keep flipping to a clean towel side just as we did with the paint; the wheels are painted too so be gentle with them. You can also keep rinsing the towels in the bucket as they get dirtier; we don't need the water for anything else now. Also wipe down the rubber mudflap and the plastic lining inside the wheel arch. Wring out one of the wheel towels and wipe dry the wheels as best as you can; complete this process for each wheel before moving on to the next one. Throw away the dirty water in mud/grass if you can or take it back home and flush it down the toilet/drain.6) Wash all the towels thoroughly in the wash machine with normal/warm water but never too hot; and hang them to air dry but not in direct sunlight. Extreme heat will destroy microfiber. The wheel towels will have brake dust/metal particles which could contaminate the paint towels and scratch the paint during the next wash; so it's best to wash them separately from the paint towels; but if you can't, it's not the end of the world. Never mix microfiber with other clothes; wash it separately always. Do not use powdered detergent/fabric softeners; only use liquid detergent; any liquid laundry detergent with no added fabric softener is fine; but I still recommend the Wavex microfiber detergent; good Indian product, cost effective and a 1 litre bottle will last you a long time.THE WASH MITT METHOD:Another variation of the rinseless wash which is my preferred one is to just use 1-2 microfiber chenille wash mitts instead of many towels. The difference here is that you would fill your bucket with around 15 litres of water, add 30ml (2ml per litre) of the concentrate and mix it well; fill up your spray bottle from the same bucket without needing to mix it separately; just like the multiple towel method, you still need to pre-spray the car before washing; that will never change; you promised to never touch your dry car.And then keep rinsing the wash mitt in the bucket after you clean each panel. The water will get dirtier as you wash the car, yes; but you added the Proklear directly to the bucket and so the water is fully lubricated; it will work its magic and sink most of the dirt down to the bottom of the bucket where your wash mitt will not/should not reach. You just need to rinse the mitt thoroughly in the top half of the bucket after washing each panel. Also, I prefer just holding the wash mitt instead of wearing it on my hand; easier to control that way and you can use both sides of the mitt before needing to rinse. Just like the first method, wash the car top to bottom and wash the lower dirtier areas last if you're only using one mitt. If you're using two mitts, thats even better; you can use one for the upper body and the other for the lower. Use separate towels/wash mitt for the wheels/tyres.At this point, I'd love to suggest that you also buy a grit/dirt guard filter for the bucket to keep the dirt trapped at the bottom; but unfortunately there are no fairly priced options available in India; a simple plastic item that should be around Rs.200/- is being sold at ridiculous prices; the cheapest one is from Wavex, around 500 and most likely they'll send you the wrong smaller sized red filter when you actually need the larger black one (it's not returnable and you'll need Amazon's lovely customer support team to help you get your money back). But Wavex also sells a 20 litre wash bucket and filter combo for 800, which is a more reasonable purchase to consider and where they'll not make the mistake of sending you the red smaller sized useless filter. But really, as long as you don't let your wash mitt go near the bottom of the bucket, you don't need the grit guard; it's just added protection.OTHER POINTS/TIPS/THOUGHTS:1) Please note that I use the wash mitt method to wash 2 regularly cleaned Toyota Innovas from the same 15 litre wash bucket with 30ml concentrate. Both cars are black too; the most unforgiving colour which shows each and every scratch/defect; and I've seen no issues other than the normal 'love marks' I talked about earlier; you can use that same mix for 1 very dirty car; or you can go down to 10 litres with 20ml concentrate for a smaller/less dirty car; no need to waste water/concentrate without reason. The wash mitt method will use more concentrate than the first method but it's still cheap; the multiple towel method will cost you 12 rupees per wash in concentrate whereas the wash mitt method will be around:- 63 rupees using 15 litres of water with 30ml concentrate for a larger or very dirty car.- 42 rupees using 10 litres of water with 20ml concentrate for a smaller or less dirty car.It's all still much cheaper than paying 300 to get your car scratched by the guys at your local car wash. This is also the reason why I personally always use the 15 litres/30ml mix rather than 10 litres/20ml; more water to rinse the wash mitt in and keep it away from the dirty bottom of the bucket.2) If you're washing outside in the sun/wind/dust, you'll need to adjust your technique slightly; you'll not pre-spray the whole car at once, you'll not wash it all at once and you'll not dry it all at once either. You'll have to work section by section because the sun will dry everything too fast. You'll spray the roof for example, then wash it, dry it immediately and then move on to the next panel until you complete the car. This is a more annoying process but that's the price you pay for washing under the sun.3) Please note that these tips/tricks apply to all brands of waterless/rinseless wash concentrates; not just Proklear. Be in no doubt, traditional pressure washing will always have a place and is necessary for very dirty muddy cars and other heavy duty applications; but rinseless washing/polymer technology is the future of car cleaning and I say that as someone who loves using the pressure washer/lots of water/lots of shampoo/foam. I did not trust rinseless technology in the beginning; but then tried it, saw the results and had no choice but to accept the truth and change my ways. 10% of the time, you'll need a pressure wash to properly clean a car; but the remaining 90%, a rinseless wash is what I'm doing on my own, my friends' and customers' cars.Sorry for the long read but I've been doing this since years and love to share my experiences/learning with those who might be looking for it. I'll also be updating this review later with a video demo of all that I've typed here. You can also see my profile for reviews of other great detailing products on Amazon and to learn more about how to take care of your detailing tools such as microfibre etc.Finally, here are my recommendations for the few products you'll need to build a great rinseless wash kit that you'll enjoy using for a long time. I've bought them, used them and love their performance/reliability. You can pick/choose other options yourself as per your preferences/budget. And about the pump sprayers; even with the good brands such as the ones I listed below, there's always a chance of you receiving a defective unit; as soon as you receive it, fill it with water, pump it up and test it. There should be no water/air leaks. After pumping up the sprayer, listen carefully for any hissing sounds/air leaks; get it replaced/refunded if there's any defects. And if out of stock on Amazon, then buy it from the manufacturers' website but you won't have the quick deliveries/customer protection that Amazon provides. I'm not allowed to leave external links here so just look for them on Google.

Does the job",4.0,"I used this product last weekend and it was impressive. I was looking for waterless car wash fluid for quite some time. Because of water scarcity in my city I've decided to limit the water wash to only when necessary. Since I used this product for the first time I did not had high hopes, but this produced really did surprised me. Not only did it remove the dust, but also removed some mud without scratching me cars paint. After buffing with microfiber cloth it did give some luster as well. Bug stains were hard but were removed by 2nd wipe. Overall it did its job. Worth the penny.

Excellent product!",5.0,"1 litre of concentrate+water in a spray bottle will be sufficient to dry wash the car, if you are generous enough.It leaves a very nice and shiny coat and smooth surface, the surface wont be as smooth like using a pure carnauba wax, but it will be good enough and you get water repellant hydrophobic coating too. I have been using it since 3+ months now and this has made my life easier, before I used to wash and then wax my car, this does everything at once and with ceramic coating.However during rainy season, would not suggest dry washing, its better to use bucket of water+shampoo to remove tough grime and dirt. But other seasons, this waterless wash does the job.

Pleasant smelling car shampoo. Wish it produced more foam..",3.0,"I used about 25ml in 4 litres of water and stirred well to produce the foam as recommended. It cleans away the dirt and does the job. Has a pleasant smell as well. I wish it produced more foam to clean it without much effort. Not quite sure about it hydrophobicity since I always polish after a good wash.

It is too big and maybe some other size for another car make and model being sold online because they could not sell it elsewhere. Material does not resist water beyond a minimal level as water enters through the cover and it gets soaking wet. Besides, the material attracts dust and makes it stick to it. Overall, bad buy.

¬†We park our cars outside and we recently had two incidents - rat bit and damaged the fuel line in my 18yr old Getz and couple of weeks later, it bit off the wiring in my wife‚Äôs Jazz. It‚Äôs not a matter of money, but rather the availability of the damaged parts and of course, the downtime. First I tried to eliminate the rat, but when I couldn‚Äôt I moved to creating a deterrent. Tried naphthalene balls, tobacco and eventually settled for spraying the engine bay with 3M rodent repellent. This was effective, but one day I saw rat droppings on the engine of the Jazz and attempted bite marks on my Getz‚Äôs fuel line. This meant the rats were revisiting and I needed to keep spraying the engine bays regularly. This is not always feasible, so I started looking for more permanent solution. I researched for devices that could be installed in the car that would keep the rats away. That‚Äôs when I came across Carcat. Went through their website in detail, read customer reviews on Amazon and other sources. One thing I realised is that the company has really put a lot of thought into their product, including researching on vermin behaviour and how to improve the product to counter the vermin menace. I didn‚Äôt find any other product which gave such detailed explanation on the problem and how the product was going to help deal with it. Sure, it‚Äôs expensive, but think of the ROI. Changing the wiring harness in the Jazz costs 17k, and if the ECM is damaged, add another 25k to that. Now imagine you having to change this frequently. In the case of my Getz, it was grounded for 7 weeks because I couldn‚Äôt find the replacement part! I had to finally source it from outside the country! So that‚Äôs that. Also, the product has nifty features, like turning off when the engine is started and the standby mode (when you go on vacation). It‚Äôs easy to install, just follow the instructions provided (which is pretty detailed I must add); it took me all of 30mins to find the spot to fix it, drill holes and finish the wiring. Adding the pictures and videos of the install done on our Jazz; one of the videos is the device disengaging when the engine is started and another one of the light works inside the engine bay when the bonnet is closed. I installed the device three days back and so far it‚Äôs doing its job. You may ask why this detailed review - well, I‚Äôm sure there are folks out there with the same predicament I was in and need a no-BS review, so here it is. I‚Äôve purchased a second device for my Getz, which I‚Äôll be installing tomorrow. And no, this is not a paid promo; I wish it was, but it isn‚Äôt. Hope this helps.Update: couldn‚Äôt upload multiple videos as Amazon doesn‚Äôt allow it. So, put all three in one. Enjoy.

Great Solution for Keeping Rodents Away!",5.0,"I've been using the CARCAT Ultrasound Rat Repellent in my car for around 11 months now, and it's been a game-changer. I had issues with rodents getting into my engine bay and chewing on wires, but since installing this device, I haven't seen any signs of them. The installation was straightforward, and it's nice that the unit is compact and unobtrusive. The ultrasonic sound seems to be doing its job without any noticeable noise inside the car. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to protect their vehicle from pesky critters!

Review of CARCAT: Effective Solution for Rat Infestation in Cars",4.0,"I recently purchased the CARCAT device to protect my car from rat bites, and I am pleased to report that it has been highly effective. Since installing the device, I have not seen any rat droppings in my car's bonnet, which is a clear indicator of its efficiency.One minor issue I encountered is that the CARCAT tends to consume battery power. However, the company has provided a solution to this by allowing the device to be put in shutdown mode when the battery level falls below 10 Amperes. This feature helps manage battery usage effectively.Overall, I would recommend the CARCAT to anyone looking to safeguard their vehicle from rat damage. Despite the minor battery consumption issue, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks, making it a worthwhile investment for car protection.

Review after using it for an year",5.0,"I purchased this unit on 27th July 2023 and it's been an year,  And so far the product is working fine.  I still hear the beep and the blinking lights.  I had purchased another product which nearly lasted few months and stopped working completely. So I went for Carcat company and so far it's working fine and I hope it continues to work going forward üòäOne of the good thing I liked about it is the good length of wire and installation kit it really provides flexibility to install it in the appropriate place inside the vehicle engine bay.Since it's running continuously it does consume battery however little it may be, so please ensure that u start the vehicle frequently atleast once a week to keep the battery charged.

Machine works!",5.0,"This machine does not stops rats from entering but it makes them run away within seconds due to its ultrasound and light. I also recommended this machine but one should also use rat repellent spray e.g. Bitter to get best result. Also have mesh installed before AC went so rats don't enter inside car cabin. There is no permanent solution for rat problem. One has to regularly check and apply spray, check that device is properly working, use car regularly. In short, This device works and if spray is not there it can save major damage. So using it is highly recommended.P.S: The attached picture clearly shows that rats are entering even after device has been there for more than 9 months, still I applied spray to avoid the entry as well. I also installed steel mesh with help.of mechanic to prevent rats from AC vent.

¬†30-June 2023: Waterproof layer didn't even sustain 1 Summer season and 1st Monsoon shower. My car is parked in the open. Color has faded within 2 months. Waterproof layer has peeled off at the roof area. Rain water got accumulated in between layers forming water bubbles. Water seepos through stitching and into the mirror pockets. I didn't expect such a poor quality of material used.May 2023:The cover for TATA Punch is oversized, covers almost 70% of the tyres. It doesn't fix snuggley though, may blow away in strong wind. The elastic is available only at the front and back sides and a belt with a buckle in the middle. Cloth is plastic-like to touch and has thin cotton lining all over inside. Seems to be water resistant.

TVS Jupiter pro and cons",4.0,"In summary:-Pro:- Value for moneyPerfect fittingHave lock button to hang with your vehicle via external lockComfort CushingVisor is tight and moves up and down during driving with just one pressure hence easy to adjust move up or down based on need at same time not loose to keep falling down while driving.--Prior to scratches on plastic visor it was great to drive in night with visor being down..was getting almost normal natural view.ConsPlastic wiser get scratches within first 5 days itself.Scratches makes it bit difficult to drive in night as lights from scratches gets distorted. Hence can not keep visor down on night which makes it similar to all other helmets in market.Design is bit tall which make it difficult / tight to keep in TVS Jupiter Scotty..hence that resulted in putting lot of scratches in middle of visor.Have to spent 2-3 mins minimum to adjust to keep it inside Scotty or else it will never fit without proper alignment.Feedback to manufacture for designRather then focusing on design reduce the height from middle of head which increases its height and make it difficult to put inside Scotty..due to need ot having 2 helmets now a we need helmet that can easily go inside Scotty as one of feature.

Nice tool",5.0,"I found this product to be very effective at removing small rocks and other debris from my tires. The hook itself is sturdy and well-made, with a comfortable grip that makes it easy to use. The curved shape of the hook allows for easy access to hard-to-reach areas, and the pointed end is perfect for dislodging stubborn debris.One of the things I appreciated most about this product is how easy it is to use. Simply slide the hook into the treads of your tire and pull it out to remove any debris. It's quick and simple, and doesn't require any special skills or training.

Perfect tool to remove the stones from car tyre",5.0,"We underestimate the need of this tool, I agree one drive after removing the stones, the tyre will instantly pickup new stones, but trust me, only when you remove the stones you will come to know how hard and tight they get stuck in between the grooves leading to a slow damage of the tyres. Also not sure how many of you have done wheel balancing, they add weights to the level of 10-15gms also. and all these stones accumulate over a period of time easliy throws off the balance of the wheels. So its good to remove them once in a while.To me it is satisfying activity to take out the stones. So I keep this in my car boot and remove the stones everytime I park and in a mood to spend some time cleaning my car.

Meguiar's Ultimate Compound Micro Abrasive technology Quickly Remove Paint Defects Scratches and Swirls Hand Application o...,"5.0 out of 5 stars
Please ignore the negative reviews",5.0,"There are some products which work for one user but not for another and you can't objectively say whether it's a good product or not.Ultimate Compound (UC) is not one of those products; it's been around for years and has been repeatedly proven and shown to be one of the absolute best compounds available to the average user like yourself and I. The professional grade aggressive compounds are even better but they're for highly experienced professional detailers and that's not what we're here for. But yes, even the professional detailers love UC and always have it in their collection.Do not pay attention to reviews that say it doesn't work; it works brilliantly; watch some YouTube videos in addition to reading these unreliable Amazon reviews; using any paint correction product with a polishing machine would give the best results but this compound is also formulated to work for the average weekend user who wants to work by hand and bring old tired paint on his car back to life.I used this on a black 10 year old Innova and you can imagine what a black 10 year old paintjob looks like in the extreme Indian weather/road conditions. I didn't have my machine, it took me 3 days to finish the whole car by hand and machine would've definitely made the job faster/easier. But I also enjoy working by hand, got the job done and the results made the 3 days of sweat and hard work worth it. Very satisfying and a great sense of accomplishment. It made me smile when my uncle asked me whether I'd had the car repainted. This was only by hand and I can't imagine how much better it would've been with a machine.And for those people saying their scratches were not removed; UC works on not just scratches but also oxidation/fading/swirls/blemishes/water spots and other defects. But as a user friendly compound which was designed to be foolproof and safe for all paintjobs, it has its limits and you need to know and accept those limits. Just remember this; if UC did not remove your scratch, then it means that you either did not work it hard enough; or it means that only advanced professional compounds and techniques like wet sanding or repainting will fix that scratch.It's a brilliant product; just remember its limits and know that there are very few consumer level products that will do as great a job as Ultimate compound. I'll say it's magic in a bottle for old tired paintjobs.If you're doing it by hand, here are my tips:1) It's very tiring to do a whole car by hand. Your tired arms will not be able to keep up that level of effort and the results will suffer too. So work on only one panel or two and stop when you're tired. Come back next day or whenever next possible. Think of it as a marathon and not a sprint; you can't finish the car in one day with good results; not by hand.2) Use a microfiber glove/pad instead of those small round foam sponges. You can also fold a microfiber towel into a thick pad. Microfiber gives much more bite/cut than soft foam pads and you get much more correction for all your effort. They're also larger and easier to work with than small foam pads. Your best options on Amazon India are:A) Softspun brand microfiber polishing pads; these come in a pack of 6; rectangle or circle shaped; with a strap to hold the pad comfortably for long periods of time; 350 rupees for the 6 pads and a superb long lasting product. I prefer the rectangle; easier to reach corners/tight areas. Link below:https://www.amazon.in/SOFTSPUN-Microfiber-Automotive-Cleaning-Polishing/dp/B01N5IMFBC/ref=cm_cr_srp_mb_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8B) Softspun brand microfiber 340 gsm glove mitt - this is 200 rupees for a glove and perfect for using Ultimate compound or any other polishing product by hand. Link below:https://www.amazon.in/SOFTSPUN-Microfiber-Multipurpose-Sided-Glove/dp/B06WWJ75PQ/ref=cm_cr_srp_mb_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8Both those products are perfect partners for this job and I've reviewed them on their product pages as well.3) Do it in the shade/garage; you can't use in direct sunlight on hot paint; any product would just dry up too fast. Do not let it touch any black plastics, rubber or unpainted areas; it will stain them; use only on painted surfaces and headlights/taillights.4) Use a fair amount; don't just take 2-3 drops for a whole door or bonnet like they show in the videos; that works only by machine on shiny new cars. For your old dirty paint, you need a nice thick circle of the compound on your pad for each panel, like one door. Divide the larger roof and hood/bonnet areas into 4 quarters; one circle of the compound for each quarter. If your headlights/taillights look yellowed/faded/scratched, use the compound to freshen them up too. Spend at least 15 minutes working on each panel and use firm pressure (like a strong manly handshake) but don't press down too hard; let the pad do more work than your hand; it's all about good technique. Work in tight circles mostly but also make repeated straight line passes in a # pattern (left right and up down), all over the panel. If it starts to dry, apply some more; never rub a dry panel; lubrication is NECESSARY. Once you're satisfied with your work, wipe/buff off immediately with a fresh clean folded microfiber cloth. There is no need or benefit to letting it stay/dry longer on the panel. It has done its job. Keep switching to a new fresh side of the folded towel as you remove/buff the compound from each panel you finish.5) Once you finish a panel, rub your polishing pad thoroughly on another dry microfiber cloth before starting the next panel. This is to clean/remove the used up compound and junk that came from the panel you just finished. It's a very important step and if you skip it, the later panels will not be as good as the earlier panels because the polishing pad is clogged and blocked with all the gunk coming off your car.This process will be enough for most people but if you want an even more refined glossy finish; you can repeat the whole process with Meguiar's Ultimate Polish. This is a finishing/refining polish and will remove any remaining haze and cloudiness that usually happens after compounding. If you're doing this, then use those soft foam pads instead of microfiber. Foam works better than microfiber when you just want to finish and refine the wonderful job done by the Ultimate Compound. This polish too should be removed after polishing and no need to let it stay/dry on the panel. Remember, this is not a necessary step and most people will be perfectly happy with just using the compound without the Ultimate Polish.Apply a strong synthetic spray sealant like 'Turtle Wax Seal N Shine' or any other wax of your choice afterwards to protect your newly restored paintwork and headlights/taillights. Always wash and dry your car gently in straight lines and never in circles. That's what causes the most swirls and scratches.Sorry for the long read but I've been doing this since years and love to share my learning/experiences with those who might be looking for it; you can also see my profile for reviews of other great detailing products on Amazon. Best of luck and happy detailing.

Does it's job",5.0,"I applied this on a new car (it's 2 months old) but had been through significant amount of mud and dust and rain. It really brought back the color that was slowly getting lost. There were a few scratches on the car. I managed to hide them reasonably well. But, not all scratches were removed. Probably, I did not work that hard on them. I tried 2-3 times on a scratch and they are reasonably conceal d. Meaning they are not visible in a casual look. Only when you inspect closely you get to see them. Happy with the product.

Proklear RAW Xtreme CRC SIO2 Hybrid Ceramic Waterless Wash Concentrate Makes 50 liters - 250ml Pack,"5.0 out of 5 stars
Best Indian waterless/rinseless wash concentrate",5.0,"As a car detailing addict that is always in search of the best performing products; it is my humble opinion that the Proklear waterless/rinseless wash is the best in India. Price/cost effectiveness/performance; it is a winner in every way. There are 3 versions of the Proklear waterless/rinseless range and all are usually available on Amazon:1) RAW: this one is a pure wash concentrate with no added waxes/sealants for shine/protection; it will give you great lubrication/cleaning and that's it; you'll have to take care of the shine/protection aspect yourself.2) RAW Xtreme CX: has added carnauba wax for a beautiful natural wax shine and some protection until the next wash. Many people don't like ceramic products on their car and prefer the natural warm wax shine; this is for them.3) RAW Xtreme CRC: this is the one we're reviewing here; the newest variant and has ceramic/SiO2 polymers plus the carnauba wax; recommended for ceramic coated cars but can be used on any car, coated or not. My favourite variant because of the added benefits of ceramic/SiO2 technology; also the costliest.All 3 are great and I'm happy to use any of them; the pure RAW variant is half the price of the other two but also requires double the dosage (10ml concentrate per litre of water whereas the other two are 5ml per litre); so no real difference price wise; whether or not you want the added wax/ceramic protection will be the deciding factor in your choice. All 3 variants have the same lovely, mild and soothing scent; not too strong like many other detailing products. Except for fabric seats/carpets, you can use these gentle pH neutral products to safely clean all surfaces of the car, interior/exterior; but you'll need stronger cleaners for very dirty/muddy/greasy interiors/wheels/engine bay.For ceramic coated cars, any/all waterless/rinseless wash products are completely safe to use; the Xtreme CX variant has carnauba wax in it which is not really needed but also not harmful for a ceramic coated car; so you can either get the RAW version or this RAW Xtreme CRC, which is especially for ceramic coated cars.I switched to rinseless washing 5 years ago and have been fully convinced/converted with regard to its safety as a method of car washing. Please note this review is about rinseless washing and not waterless washing; two completely different methods. I'm still not convinced about waterless washing and feel it is a high risk method which is only for lightly dusty cars and for experienced detailers who know the secrets of waterless washing in and out; there are no lightly dusty cars in India and most of the people reading this are not experienced detailers; I would suggest that average users completely avoid this method; if you don't really care about your paint to that high level and just want the car clean without using buckets/water, then sure, go for it and the rest of this review will be a waste of your time; I've already said that this product is your best option even for a waterless wash. But if you're interested in protecting your paint while washing; keep reading.Unfortunately, I'm seeing a lot of misinformation/wrong techniques, both among the users and manufacturers. The Proklear product is excellent but I'm sorry to say that their video demonstration is pretty wrong; it bothers me to think how many people are washing their cars like that and unknowingly scratching their paint in the long run.We won't waste time talking about how others are doing it wrong; I'll just share a few tricks/methods which will help you master the art (yes, it's an art) of doing a safe rinseless wash using the least amount of water and with an end result which looks as good as or even better than a pressure wash. It's also important to remember that it's impossible to touch car paint without scratching; the washing/drying processes both will cause microscopic scratches which build up over time and become more visible to the eye; these tiny scratches are called 'love marks' in the detailing world because they happen when you're washing/loving/taking care of your car; the real goal of good wash techniques is to MINIMISE scratches; it's impossible to prevent them 100% even with the best technique.NEVER dust/wipe a dry car; throw away your Jopasu duster/any other duster and never again touch your car when it's dry. You are literally grinding/rubbing the dry dirt into your delicate paint. If you learn only one thing from this review, let it be this one. It's sad to see people dry dusting their car. Leave your car dirty/dusty until you get time to wash it properly and safely; just don't dry clean it, pleaseü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èTHE MULTIPLE TOWEL METHOD; also known as the Gary Dean method; a well known American detailer who thought of this brilliant technique as I'll explain below:1) You CANNOT wash a car safely without scratches using just 1-2 towels as shown in many videos. You'll never see a manufacturer video where they wash the whole car with the same 1-2 towels; they only work on one or two body panels for the video demo.But you CAN achieve a great safe wash with:a) 4-5 microfibre wash towels for the paint/bodyb) 2 dedicated wheel/tyre towels which should NEVER be used on the paintc) 1 specialised drying toweld) 1 dry towel for final buffing to activate the wax/ceramic shineThe trick is to fold each wash towel twice so that you end up with 8 square sides in each towel. Place the folded towels in your bucket and fill it with enough water to get the towels wet/underwater.2) Now, the important part; you already promised to not touch your car when dry; if you don't have a spray bottle lying around in the house, you can buy a good 1 litre spray bottle for around Rs.100/- on Amazon or in the shops; or just use a big empty Coke/Pepsi bottle and buy only the spray trigger heads to fit onto the bottle. I prefer buying the trigger heads because that's what usually breaks and not the bottle; it's good to have a set of triggers in stock and just replace them when they break. If you want an even better but more costly option, get yourself a 2 litre pump sprayer which will save you the time/effort of repeatedly pressing the spray trigger. I'll list some good/affordable options for all these products at the end of the review so don't think about that for now.Fill your bottle/sprayer with water; add 5ml of the Proklear concentrate per one litre of water and shake it up well. Generously spray the wash solution over the whole car; don't be cheap with it; all the brands say you can clean a car with 500 ml of their solution but in my experience, that's too less. Use the full 1 litre bottle and get the car as soaked/wet as possible; waterless/rinseless polymer technology works by lifting/enveloping the dirt and holding it in a lubricated layer above the paint surface to be cleaned off during washing; so you need to have enough solution on the car to lubricate the dirt on the paint. Hold the bottle close to the car; the spray force helps to rinse away loose dirt before you even touch the car. This is especially helpful for the lower body, which tends to be the dirtiest.3) With the car wet, take a folded wash towel from the bucket you prepared earlier; lightly squeeze most of the water back into the bucket but the towel should still be dripping wet. Using one side of the towel, clean only half a body panel; for example, half the roof or bonnet. Flip to a fresh side of the towel and clean the other half. Flip again and give the full panel one final wipe to pick up any remaining dirt. That last side used for the final wipe will still be clean so re-use it to clean another area such as the glass/plastics. The aim/logic is to work clean, work efficiently and to keep changing to a fresh side of the towel as you work your way around the car. Once you use up all 8 clean sides, set aside the dirty towel, take a fresh one from your bucket and continue. Do not rub the towel hard into the paint; gently wipe each panel in long straight lines and never in circles. Do not use any pressure; lightly guide the folded towel under your palm and let the wet weight of the towel do the work. For the front, sides and back of the car, wash from top to bottom because the lower areas are the dirtiest, as mentioned earlier. Clean the door/trunk jambs at the same time as the doors/trunk. This way you can just dry them later along with the rest of the car.4) With the car washed/clean, now comes the drying stage and the steps below are just as important to prevent scratches as the steps we had in the wash stage. Your drying towel also should be slightly damp before you start drying with it; microfibre just works better that way. You can either dip it in the remaining water from your clean towel bucket and then wring it as dry as you can; or spray it generously with your wash solution, whichever method you prefer. As an extra optional step, lightly spray some solution again on each panel before you start drying, for added lubrication. Fold the drying towel twice or thrice into a nice thick pad and gently wipe the car in one direction, in straight lines and never in circles. Do not rub the towel hard into the paint; no pressure; lightly guide it under your palm and let its weight do the work. Keep flipping to a fresh side as it gets wetter. If you're using a smaller towel, keep wringing the water out as you work your way around the car. Blow with your mouth into the tight areas like door handles/mirrors/corners to remove the water that usually collects there; your lungs will get a good workout too. If you don't have another drying towel only for glass, then dry the glass first before the body; you will have less streaks/smears on the glass that way. Once dry, GENTLY buff/wipe the whole car with the dry buffing towel to remove the wax/ceramic residue and activate the shine. You can skip this last step if in a hurry or if using a pure wash concentrate with no added wax/sealant.5) Great, so your car is clean/dry; but we still have the remaining water in the bucket and also those 2 folded wheel/tyre towels in it. I wonder what we could do with them; ah yes, we could clean the wheels! Clean the wheel first and then its tyre; keep flipping to a clean towel side just as we did with the paint; the wheels are painted too so be gentle with them. You can also keep rinsing the towels in the bucket as they get dirtier; we don't need the water for anything else now. Also wipe down the rubber mudflap and the plastic lining inside the wheel arch. Wring out one of the wheel towels and wipe dry the wheels as best as you can; complete this process for each wheel before moving on to the next one. Throw away the dirty water in mud/grass if you can or take it back home and flush it down the toilet/drain.6) Wash all the towels thoroughly in the wash machine with normal/warm water but never too hot; and hang them to air dry but not in direct sunlight. Extreme heat will destroy microfiber. The wheel towels will have brake dust/metal particles which could contaminate the paint towels and scratch the paint during the next wash; so it's best to wash them separately from the paint towels; but if you can't, it's not the end of the world. Never mix microfiber with other clothes; wash it separately always. Do not use powdered detergent/fabric softeners; only use liquid detergent; any liquid laundry detergent with no added fabric softener is fine; but I still recommend the Wavex microfiber detergent; good Indian product, cost effective and a 1 litre bottle will last you a long time.THE WASH MITT METHOD:Another variation of the rinseless wash which is my preferred one is to just use 1-2 microfiber chenille wash mitts instead of many towels. The difference here is that you would fill your bucket with around 15 litres of water, add 30ml (2ml per litre) of the concentrate and mix it well; fill up your spray bottle from the same bucket without needing to mix it separately; just like the multiple towel method, you still need to pre-spray the car before washing; that will never change; you promised to never touch your dry car.And then keep rinsing the wash mitt in the bucket after you clean each panel. The water will get dirtier as you wash the car, yes; but you added the Proklear directly to the bucket and so the water is fully lubricated; it will work its magic and sink most of the dirt down to the bottom of the bucket where your wash mitt will not/should not reach. You just need to rinse the mitt thoroughly in the top half of the bucket after washing each panel. Also, I prefer just holding the wash mitt instead of wearing it on my hand; easier to control that way and you can use both sides of the mitt before needing to rinse. Just like the first method, wash the car top to bottom and wash the lower dirtier areas last if you're only using one mitt. If you're using two mitts, thats even better; you can use one for the upper body and the other for the lower. Use separate towels/wash mitt for the wheels/tyres.At this point, I'd love to suggest that you also buy a grit/dirt guard filter for the bucket to keep the dirt trapped at the bottom; but unfortunately there are no fairly priced options available in India; a simple plastic item that should be around Rs.200/- is being sold at ridiculous prices; the cheapest one is from Wavex, around 500 and most likely they'll send you the wrong smaller sized red filter when you actually need the larger black one (it's not returnable and you'll need Amazon's lovely customer support team to help you get your money back). But Wavex also sells a 20 litre wash bucket and filter combo for 800, which is a more reasonable purchase to consider and where they'll not make the mistake of sending you the red smaller sized useless filter. But really, as long as you don't let your wash mitt go near the bottom of the bucket, you don't need the grit guard; it's just added protection.OTHER POINTS/TIPS/THOUGHTS:1) Please note that I use the wash mitt method to wash 2 regularly cleaned Toyota Innovas from the same 15 litre wash bucket with 30ml concentrate. Both cars are black too; the most unforgiving colour which shows each and every scratch/defect; and I've seen no issues other than the normal 'love marks' I talked about earlier; you can use that same mix for 1 very dirty car; or you can go down to 10 litres with 20ml concentrate for a smaller/less dirty car; no need to waste water/concentrate without reason. The wash mitt method will use more concentrate than the first method but it's still cheap; the multiple towel method will cost you 12 rupees per wash in concentrate whereas the wash mitt method will be around:- 63 rupees using 15 litres of water with 30ml concentrate for a larger or very dirty car.- 42 rupees using 10 litres of water with 20ml concentrate for a smaller or less dirty car.It's all still much cheaper than paying 300 to get your car scratched by the guys at your local car wash. This is also the reason why I personally always use the 15 litres/30ml mix rather than 10 litres/20ml; more water to rinse the wash mitt in and keep it away from the dirty bottom of the bucket.2) If you're washing outside in the sun/wind/dust, you'll need to adjust your technique slightly; you'll not pre-spray the whole car at once, you'll not wash it all at once and you'll not dry it all at once either. You'll have to work section by section because the sun will dry everything too fast. You'll spray the roof for example, then wash it, dry it immediately and then move on to the next panel until you complete the car. This is a more annoying process but that's the price you pay for washing under the sun.3) Please note that these tips/tricks apply to all brands of waterless/rinseless wash concentrates; not just Proklear. Be in no doubt, traditional pressure washing will always have a place and is necessary for very dirty muddy cars and other heavy duty applications; but rinseless washing/polymer technology is the future of car cleaning and I say that as someone who loves using the pressure washer/lots of water/lots of shampoo/foam. I did not trust rinseless technology in the beginning; but then tried it, saw the results and had no choice but to accept the truth and change my ways. 10% of the time, you'll need a pressure wash to properly clean a car; but the remaining 90%, a rinseless wash is what I'm doing on my own, my friends' and customers' cars.Sorry for the long read but I've been doing this since years and love to share my experiences/learning with those who might be looking for it. I'll also be updating this review later with a video demo of all that I've typed here. You can also see my profile for reviews of other great detailing products on Amazon and to learn more about how to take care of your detailing tools such as microfibre etc.Finally, here are my recommendations for the few products you'll need to build a great rinseless wash kit that you'll enjoy using for a long time. I've bought them, used them and love their performance/reliability. You can pick/choose other options yourself as per your preferences/budget. And about the pump sprayers; even with the good brands such as the ones I listed below, there's always a chance of you receiving a defective unit; as soon as you receive it, fill it with water, pump it up and test it. There should be no water/air leaks. After pumping up the sprayer, listen carefully for any hissing sounds/air leaks; get it replaced/refunded if there's any defects. And if out of stock on Amazon, then buy it from the manufacturers' website but you won't have the quick deliveries/customer protection that Amazon provides. I'm not allowed to leave external links here so just look for them on Google.

Does the job",4.0,"I used this product last weekend and it was impressive. I was looking for waterless car wash fluid for quite some time. Because of water scarcity in my city I've decided to limit the water wash to only when necessary. Since I used this product for the first time I did not had high hopes, but this produced really did surprised me. Not only did it remove the dust, but also removed some mud without scratching me cars paint. After buffing with microfiber cloth it did give some luster as well. Bug stains were hard but were removed by 2nd wipe. Overall it did its job. Worth the penny.

Sprayed, wiped, buffed the car and got very clean shiny surface. Used the diluted liquid for almost 5 times. Very little liquid required everytime you clean the car. Really waterless wash, but use 2 different microfiber cloth as per guidelines to get best cleaning. Glass panels now slide down water very easily. Wipers are very smooth in action now. Overall it's the best product I have used so far for my car. Happy with the purchase. Delivery, packaging was proper and on time. Thank you !

Excellent product!",5.0,"1 litre of concentrate+water in a spray bottle will be sufficient to dry wash the car, if you are generous enough.It leaves a very nice and shiny coat and smooth surface, the surface wont be as smooth like using a pure carnauba wax, but it will be good enough and you get water repellant hydrophobic coating too. I have been using it since 3+ months now and this has made my life easier, before I used to wash and then wax my car, this does everything at once and with ceramic coating.However during rainy season, would not suggest dry washing, its better to use bucket of water+shampoo to remove tough grime and dirt. But other seasons, this waterless wash does the job.

Second shot, applied and drive the car down a dusty road and a small highway track. May need regular applications but I guess the quantity is more than enough for a couple of years.Update: the shots got mixed up during upload. First shot shows the tyre after the drive (looking pretty good) and the rusty looking tyre is the 'before' shot.

It is cheaper than other seller, they selling this product in about 1750 rs. and SOREX is selling this in 1485 rs. So on Amazon it is the cheapest spoiler light.  Thanks Best deals for you  Final verdict....If you are searching for spoiler light just buy it you won't regret, in local car accessories marketthey are selling in about 2000-2500 rs. This is like DIY accessories. Only you have to spent not more than 20-50 rs. for wiring connection. Only when you don't know the wiring.

Decent replacement for Xcent Keyfob",5.0,"The keypad looks to be of good quality. The key markings are clear. Need to wait and see if the markings can withstand daily use. Fits very well in the existing key. I only had to cut off the alignment rubber stumps in the back of the keypad to fit properly. I used Fevibond glue to stick the keypad after carefully removing the old keypad with a box cutter which had completely disintegrated with 5 years of use. Overall good quality for the money spent. Will update this review if there are any problems with regular use.

Workable alternative",3.0,"As others may have pointed out in the reviews, its not the perfect size but you can use a glue like fevikwik to at least give your battered key fob a new life. I have ordered a second one now after using the key for a few weeks.Two reasons why I'm not giving it 4 stars1. Its just a piece of rubber and the price is unjustified. If the seller could provide 2-3 pieces, it may be worth the almost 200 INR price2. The fit is not perfect and no matter how much you stuff it into the key fob, it'll just barely stay in place. Plus you have to use your own glue as no adhesion tape is supplied with the product.

Does what it is supposed to",5.0,"Good substitute to original keypad for a replacement.It certainly helps to fix the damaged rubber. The complete key shell replacement costs about 1500 inr in local market. This saved the unwanted costs.The rubber is good, however you wont feel the hardness as the original one. There remains a little vaccum around the buttons after applying it, but will get used to it.Overall a good one.Note - It doesn't have adhesive. Ensure that the original press buttons of each function are intact before replacement.

¬†I do not take time to write review but this product is such low quality that I am forced to write it . Does not fit well to begin with for the Himalayan . That‚Äôs still fine but it‚Äôs just tearing away from ever side such poor quality . I regret buying this . Should have gone with showroom cover which is ages ahead . Badly engineered and quality is poor

Very HOT. No Fan. POOR Build. Disappointed.",1.0,"Very very poor build. Screw fell off from the box when unpacking and it had some moving parts inside. Maybe it broke on the way or they supplied me a broken device. Thinking of returning it. Moreover, No fans has been used. Continuous use leads to smoking from the transformer. It gets soo hot that i feared that it might catch fire and had to switch it off when i went to sleep. It works though but not at all reliable as it may catch fire or melt anytime. Wire quality is very poor. I think one can make this device at home with basic class 12 electronics knowledge and it would be cheaper than this for sure. Extremely disappointed.

But this is just a 5Amp charger.2088 rupees for a 5amp charger and that too for a non copper winding transformer is a loss for customer.No cooling facility and that is why charger gets too hot.I had to install a 12volt cooling fan with a 12volt voltage regulator circuit for fan to keep the transformer from overheating.Not happy with the dealer.

¬†The charger is bit sturdy and has handmade build quality. You can only expect this build quality for a price we paid for the product.Pros:1. Budget friendly charger which can charge from car battery to truck battery of 220AH 12v.2. Fast charging option3. Nice and tuff crocodile pin and wire4. Cut of fuse which can prevent the box from reversing and burning circuit5. Power booster switch to boost battery üîã faster6. Lighter in weight and harder in subject7. Make in India product and 6months warranty8. One device for charging all battery series very portableCons:1. Makes zzzzzz noise while charging2.. Only amp meter provided could be better if we can get a volt meter aswell3. Device of this sought should have come with 3 pin plug with grounding option4. Should have one fan fixed inside as the box gets heated in long hours of charging5. Normal winded transform could have been better if copper winded6. Should have auto cutoff or battery reverse protection when battery is fully charged7. Quality of switch could have been betterWho should buy this ??If you have a car, inverter or other heavy battery consumption, this box is for you. You can store this box in safe and compact space. Dosent take much space. If you have a bike battery to charge this won't be the box for you. You should invest in low budget charger which comes for 600 to 800 range in Amazon.I have written this review post using it for 72 hours and I will post detailed review after 2 weeks.After using for 6 month:I would say this is one of the best made in india product.Charged Following-1. Bike battery 12v (Honda Activa)2. Bike battery 12v (Royal Enfield Thunderbird x)3. Car Battery - Baleno, Tata Nano, Indica v2 2014 model.4. Inverter Battery 15AH Exide5. Bus battery- 250AHWorks amazing and hasn't failed me till now.Just buy it if you need multipurpose charging requirements like mine.

Perfect for TV with 2 BT headphones",5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†I wanted a solution to connect 2 BT headphones with my TV. I read quite a few reviews about Tewtross, Muesonic and Signature and finally decided to buy this along with compatible BT headphones of Tewtross itself so that my wife and I can watch TV together without disturbing our baby.Pros - Just follow the instructions and you cannot go wrong, it's very easy to connect- I am using it with 2 BT headphones - Sennheiser PXC550 and Tewtross over the ear headphones and the sound comes in both without any lag or loss of sound quality. There is no visible lip-sync delay.- Out of the box, it got fully charged in 30mins. I have used it for over 15 hours now (an hour or so daily) but the battery was still there. Anyhow, I decided to charge it and it took 1.5 hours to charge completely.- It is very very compact and easy to carry on trips as well. Just the size of a matchbox- looks and feels premium and doesn't look like cheap quality plastic- comes with optical cable. Basically you have all options to connect with it - AUX, optical, RCA- The power button is responsive and quick to function- Tx and Rx modes work perfectlyCons -- The aux wire that comes with it is very small, but I am using my own long aux wire.- At times 1 out of 2 headphones doesn't connect automatically. This happens only if that headphone was previously connected to some other device like my phone or laptop. No worries, just double click the power button on this device and restart your 2nd pair of headphone again, it connects in about 5 seconds. Haven't faced any connectivity issues as such.Overall, am very happy with the purchase.

Go for it!",4.0,"I bought this product primarily to watch TV without disturbing family members. Based on reviews I bought this product and I wasn't disappointed.As always, the product was neatly packed and comes with the Adapter unit and wires as shown in the picture.The product brochure is informative, but as always with most Chinese-made products expect grammatical errors.Pros:1. Good sound quality2. The Bluetooth range is good and can cover a regular sized home*3. It is discreet and due to minimalist design, it has a very small footprint and hangs behind the TVCons1. There is a noticeable audio lag. This may not necessarily be the issue with the product as audio via Bluetooth is known to have lags. This is something that I may have to fix. But I am still mentioning it because you need to know what to expect if you order it.2. Noticed the asterisk after point #2 in Pro section? This is because the audio stops transmitting when you are not in a straight line3. Due to its minimalist design it takes some time to get used to the various beep codes and click patterns. But then hey... I do a lot of complex tasks in my daily life... So i can live with it. Its not a deal breaker for me.

Superb value and Excellent build",5.0,"I looked up many Bluetooth Tx/Rx to convert my Altec Lansing speakers and when I saw this, I wondered why so expensive. Ordered and this came before time. Thanks. Amazon.The package had a sticker giving mobile numbers to call in case of difficulty in Setup, and same number for Registration of product for 12 months and additional free 3 months.Open the box and the device sits neatly in a foam cutout. Just the size of three fingers held up. Build quality is Superb. Neat layout of On/Off button on top, Pair button on side, below the On/Off button.The Tx/Rx and SPDIF/Aux select buttons laid on the right side of the device. The connecting Ports with SPDIF RX, SPDIF TX, and the AUX ports are on the rear.Connecting was a breeze. The Altec Lansing speakers played music wirelessly, instantly. One older VU tv could connect to Bluetooth Headphones immediately thru both SPDIF TX as well as the AUX.The new VU Smart tv could  not play thru Bose QC 35II Headphones. Need to check settings on tv and try with the SPDIF.Battery back up is very high. 21 hours if connected to SPDIF and 26 hours on AUX.You can put this in your pocket too and take it anywhere to cinject Device at that place.Recommend this highly. Top class product.

Utility Product for 2 channel speaker systems. Skip bt receivers altogether for 5.1.",3.0,"Editing review after 6months of use. The product is good but the issue is with wireless standards. Even though TOSLINK output exist, only stereo channels are transmitted over bluetooth. You can check this on control panel> sound>Tewtross>Properties>Advanced. My 5.1 used Dolby Prologic to create virtual surround from stereo but its not the same as real surround; yours may not have such features. I can't justify 2.5k price when the target speakers setups themselves cost close to that. Look for wifi usb hubs which can make usb soundcards and other gadgets wireless.--I bought it for aptx and TOSLINK. AptX,AptXHD works amazing. The necessary TOSLINK port even lights up so you know where to put the optical cable.Keep in mind: Windows 10+ supports basic Aptx on any transmitter. Intel BT transmitters(atleast mine) additionally support AptX Low Latency. AptX HD is only available for Qualcomm transmitters and few select phones. Basic AptX will show notification on Windows 10 when in use, but other AptX will not.AptX LL was extremely choppy for me. Both in Aux and TOSLINK. It might be due to my Intel Bluetooth 9260 transmitter in my laptop or it might be fault of this product. When I go to driver settings and disable Low Latency, sound works normally.I have not tried any other similar product so I am not sure whether it is the fault of this product or my wireless card.

The item is exactly like it is shown in the picture.It does not come with a 3M Adhesive tape but if you have any other good quality double sided tape at home then fixing this figurine to the dashboard wont be a problem.

"ArmourMe Anti Fog Spray | Anti Mist for Glass & Plastic| Treatment For Car Window, Windshield, Glass, Mirror, Helmet| Glas...","5.0 out of 5 stars
A Clear Road Ahead!",5.0,"As a frequent driver who has faced the frustrating and hazardous issue of foggy windows during my morning commutes, I decided to give ArmourMe Anti-Fog for Cars a try. After testing it in various weather conditions, I can confidently say that it lives up to its promises, making my driving experience significantly safer and more enjoyable.Pros:1. Effective Anti-Fog Solution: The most critical aspect of any anti-fog product is its effectiveness, and ArmourMe delivers in this department. Upon application, it forms a clear protective barrier on the car windows, preventing the formation of fog in cold and humid weather.2. Long-Lasting Performance: I was pleased to find that a single application of ArmourMe Anti-Fog lasts for an extended period. Even after several days of use, my car's windows remained fog-free, reducing the need for constant reapplication.3. Enhanced Safety: Improved visibility is essential for safe driving, and this product certainly delivers on that front. It significantly minimizes the time spent clearing fog from the windows, allowing me to focus more on the road ahead.4. Easy Application: The application process is straightforward and hassle-free. The product comes with clear instructions, and the spray bottle design makes it easy to evenly apply the solution on the glass surfaces.Cons:Limited to Interior Surface Only: One drawback of ArmourMe Anti-Fog for Cars is its inability to be used on the outside surface of car windows. This restriction means it doesn't address external fogging, potentially affecting visibility during certain weather conditions.Overall, ArmourMe Anti-Fog for Cars is a game-changer for drivers battling foggy windows and helmets.

However the switch and speed control started giving problems after a few days of work. Also the motor heats up too much after a few minutes of usage. I think I RECEIVED A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. It has completely stopped working within a months time. I had to take it to Authroized service center which is out side city to investigate and fix the problem. I expected it to be sturdy and durable product, but on the contrary its very poorly designed product. I do not recommend this product.

Worth the price",4.0,"After lot of deliberations, purchased this with low expectations on waterproof abilities (& product too claimed only to be ""water resistant""). After using for few weeks under rain, here is what I observed.üìå Positives:- Looks nice üòä- It is indeed water resistant- Barring the stitch/joins, it does a decent job on blocking water- Inside soft cushion does help in heat resistance & also prevents undue scratches- Post rain spells I checked and noticed that this cover does a GOOD job under light rains/drizzle, and does an OK job under strong downpour (can't stop water from sipping through the stitches). But we have to agree that full waterproof will also mean, internal moisture/heat will find it hard to come out.üìå Negatives:- Fits Nexon OK, but the tie strap is bit too tight (it seems a TIGHT fit)- Strap lock could have been better- I would have preferred the cover to have pocket for the shark fin antenna (it has ORVM pockets, not antenna)- Overall cover fitting is OK, but height could have been a bit more (to cover water splash on tyres)üìå Do I recommend to buy?- If you are parking your Nexon in the open, you will need a cover and this one does a good job at the price point. I will therefore recommend this.If this review was of any help, please do mark it. üôè

"Philips T10 X-Treme Ultinon 127996700KX2 LED Exterior Light (12V, 1W)","5.0 out of 5 stars
Nice product.",5.0,"As it is Philips branded so no doubting of its quality and reliability. Now take care of what color temperature you chose. There is a science behind it!!! The higher is the color temperature (e.g. 6700K/ 6200K/ 6000K etc...), the more blueish is the light. It has all got to do with science of the flame. The hotter is the flame, the more blueish is its color. And lesser is the heat of flame, the more yellowish is its color.I purchased the product before i got to know all this science, when i found that the color of the light was little more inclined towards ""blue"". And i was expecting for pure white light, as i took it for granted that LEDs are supposed to be pure white (as in household LED bulbs by Philips!). That also means, its forgone conclusion that i didn't looked for color temperature written on the packaging of the household LEDs (and certainly its written over there). Its my bad, but i got to learn the tech bits. Overall, am pretty much fine with the product. If you're looking for even more whiter color of LED then probably go for the one with 6000K (from philips of course!!!).

Product is good but price is too high",3.0,"Product is good but price is too high. I am using a Philips Xtreme Vision + headlight in my bike. It produces very bright light and serves the purpose better than the stock (Duke 200). But this Philips T10 does not look good in contrast with Xtreme vision +.  I am thinking of switching back to the stock old fashioned parking light as its color temperature is similar to that of the headlight that I am using. So if you prefer having a white parking light with yellow white headlight and/or if you are ready to spend over 1000 bucks  for this product go for it. I am not saying this light is bad but doesn't go with my bikes headlight.

The silver part in between looks a little bit cheap when looked closely, but hey this is a cheap cover! I love this one for the price.If you are looking for grip in the steering wheel, don't buy this one. If you are looking for a comfortable cover to rest your hands during long drives, then get this one. At this price, I just bought it as a trial and now I'm very happy with it. The stitches do look flimsy, will update on the longevity of this cover in a few weeks/months.

You can see the holes not aligned perfectly with the knobs. Precision is the need you should be asking from your supplier.3.

You can safely use it on any expensive cars.Lastly as mentioned on the product itself It has Advanced sudsing action which will gently and safely lifts dirt and grime which will not streak or spot.

Excellent product .. Worth the price paid",5.0,"Amazing product from Prigan india.. i have seen alot of people commenting about build quality issues and how its overpriced from the material aspect .. so i was very sceptic after ordering.. however after opening the package i was not so disappointed with the finish and build quality .. its far better and sturdy than the 200 rs local ones .. plastic quality is decent and looks premium.. though not so sturdy like the stock ones i got from maruti .. now coming to the installation it was very easy just had to put the ring in place and then install ... Surprisingly it has the same snug and tight fit like the stock ones .. some people said they used ziplocks as its very loose but i didnt face any such issues .. tried pulling it as well with mild force after installing but didnt come out .. and looks wise can be seen in the photo completely changed the look of the wheels .. very hard to tell from a distance whether its alloy wheel or steel .. overall very much satisfied with the purchase as of now .. not sure about the longevity though .. stock ones from maruti are still in proper shape after 4 years .. lets see how these stay .. people planning to buy go for Prigan ..

Paint quality is bad!",2.0,"Looks good as you observe it from a decent far distance but looks gappy from the center of the wheel. Hence fit is not goodPaint quality is really bad! As on unboxing there is alredy some scratches and as i fit it its just get white pretty quicky even on a kiss like collision. Not worth it man.
