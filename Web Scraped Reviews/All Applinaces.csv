Good purchase",5.0,"We have been using this Mixer Grinder for more than a month now. It is well built and doesn't vibrate too much while in use. I had returned a Philips Mixer earlier as it was shaking all over when switched on. Bajaj Mixer looks simple yet elegant and the motor is powerful. Sound is a little high as expected from a 750w Mixer. We get 4 jars and it is a blessing. The attachment in the middle of the juicer jar can be removed and even that jar can be used for other purposes.  But the dome shaped lid of this jar is fragile and it already started showing a crack, even though we never dropped it. I got it at a very good price below Rs. 2500 during GIF sale including bank discount, so no complaints.

Fantastic Portable Blender for Parents on the Go!",5.0,"We recently purchased this portable blender for our 7-month-old daughter, who just started eating solids. We wanted to ensure we could provide her with fresh, homemade fruit purees and blended cooked food while on a trip, and this blender exceeded our expectations.Being portable and battery-operated, it has been a lifesaver on road trips. We cook her food, pack it, and when it's time for her lunch or dinner, we simply blend it and serve it fresh. It has also made preparing fruit purees while traveling incredibly convenient.Overall, this blender is a great product. We now use it daily because it's so convenient and easy to clean. It has even become our go-to appliance for making shakes for ourselves, and it performs perfectly every time.Highly recommend this portable blender to any parent looking for a reliable and easy-to-use solution for preparing fresh food for their little one on the go!

Powerful Motor:The motor is strong enough to blend baby food smoothly, which is primarily what we use it for while traveling.cons:1.Bit expensive compared to other available products in Amazon.2. Packaging could be better.Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase. The Instacuppa portable blender is a reliable and efficient tool that has made our traveling experience much more convenient, especially for preparing baby food. Highly recommended.

The BEST electric chopper!",5.0,"This is an excellent chopping machine, the 400w motor makes short work of chopping vegetables, as do the extremely sharp steel blades, you can vary the size of chopped pieces by varying the length of time you keep the machine running, the longer you hold, the finer it cuts veggies, we tried hard vegetables like carrot and beet root, the machine chopped up these hard veggies with absolute ease and the 500ml bowl is large enough to cut veggies for the whole family at one go….love this machine and would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an electric chopping machine as this is the best….❤️

When it does work, it works great, but it’s not reliable. The size and double blades are wonderful, making it easy to chop or blend large batches of things, but again, only when it decides to work.

good product but company service is not as its company reputation very poor",1.0,"I recently purchased the Kent Hand Blender with high hopes of a reliable and efficient kitchen appliance. However, my experience with this product has been nothing short of a disappointment, and the lack of proper customer care support has added insult to injury.From the outset, the Kent Hand Blender failed to meet even the most basic expectations. The motor seemed weak and struggled to blend even simple ingredients. I tried using it for various tasks such as making smoothies, pureeing soups, and preparing sauces, but it consistently fell short. The blender's blades were ineffective in properly chopping or blending the ingredients, leaving behind unwanted chunks and an overall unappetizing texture.Adding to my frustration was the abysmal customer care support offered by Kent. When I reached out to their helpline for assistance, I encountered endless wait times, unhelpful representatives, and an overall lack of concern for my concerns. It seemed as if they were uninterested in addressing my issue and just wanted to get me off the line as quickly as possible. Despite numerous attempts, I was unable to get a satisfactory resolution to my blender's performance problems.What's even more frustrating is that I discovered many other users experiencing similar issues with the Kent Hand Blender. It's evident that this product suffers from significant quality control problems, and the lack of proper customer support further amplifies the dissatisfaction.In terms of design, the Kent Hand Blender falls short as well. The overall construction feels flimsy, and the buttons and controls are poorly placed and difficult to operate. It's apparent that this blender was not built to withstand regular use or provide a reliable performance in the kitchen.Given the consistent underperformance of the Kent Hand Blender and the sheer lack of assistance from their customer care team, I strongly advise against purchasing this product. Save yourself the frustration, disappointment, and wasted money by exploring alternative options from more reputable brands that prioritize both product quality and customer satisfaction

Product is OK",3.0,"The paniyarakkal pan is undeniably effective for making delicious snacks, but it does have a minor issue. After extended use exceeding 20 minutes, the handle tends to emit an unpleasant odor. This odor can be a bit bothersome, but it doesn't compromise the pan's cooking performance. It's a reliable kitchen tool for preparing delectable paniyarams and other snacks, provided you can overlook the handle's occasional odor issue. Overall, it's a worthwhile addition to your culinary arsenal, offering tasty results despite this minor inconvenience.

Decent suction power, but it’s somewhat limited",4.0,"recently purchased the Eureka Forbes Quick Clean DX Vacuum Cleaner with 1200 Watts Powerful Suction Control and have been using it for a while now. Overall, it does a good job and I’m quite satisfied with my purchase.The vacuum cleaner has decent suction power, but it’s somewhat limited. For accumulated hard dust, I find it necessary to first use a brush to loosen the dust before vacuuming it up. This extra step ensures a thorough clean but adds a bit more time to the cleaning process.One issue I’ve noticed is that the motor generates a lot of heat. After about 10-15 minutes of continuous use, the vacuum cleaner needs a break to cool down. This can be a bit inconvenient if you’re trying to clean a larger area in one go. However, with frequent intervals, it manages to get the job done efficiently.Despite these minor drawbacks, I am a happy customer. The vacuum cleaner is lightweight and easy to maneuver, and it handles routine cleaning tasks quite well. If you’re looking for an affordable and effective vacuum cleaner, this one is worth considering. Just be prepared for a few breaks during longer cleaning sessions!

Product Damage received twice, refund initiated, Amazon after sales support at ease with 5 star",1.0,"Kalyan East, MaharashtraAfter 1-week research on product from various website and brand, I have decided to buy from Amazon RT34T4513S8.Inquired with on store support, Samsung online store delivered by Savex Technologies and amazon support, found comfortable with Door to Door delivery offered by amazon and support on damage product recommended for large appliance to be unboxed by Samsung technician for his inspection and demo report.Since, It was my 1st large appliances order from amazon, I was afraid of damage product but being large appliance it is inherent risk of damage while delivery (loading or unloading) irrespective of online or offline stores.My experience from 2014 was favourable and comfortable to amazon as against others e-commorce. Hence, opted to buy from amazon. However, unfortunate thing happens due to logistics service delivery.I ordered product on Sep 20, 2020 and received within schedule time of 2 days but cannot unboxed  due to recommended aspect. Curiosity to see newly addition to our family was at high. Immediately, raise service request to Samsung for demo and installation. After 1 days waiting time, found the product being damage on bottom and top, very dissatisfied and facts of being afraid came to true.Replacement raised with customer installation report provided by Samsung executive and after 2 days replaced product received and that too was damage. Same procedure followed and this time refund initiated as per amazon policy and found reasonable and appropriate.Feedback on product- Can't comment on usability experience on product as it was not even plug to board to hear the noise.Feedback on Amazon after sales support- Yes it is 5 star. Superb support and ease of procedure for replacement and refund.Recommendation to Amazon- For all the small packages, risk of damage are minimal and packaging are good. However, with respect to Large appliances risk of damage and dent are inheritance to it due to heavy weight, Delivery factors such as loading and unloading, mindset of those delivery executive. However, such risk can be reduced with trained and designated staff for large appliances, Bubble wrapped packaging with due care on loading and unloading.In my instance, I have noted that the packaging came with standard brown box by Samsung but I have seen on off store, it was bubble wrapped package to avoid additional cost on replacement.Since, my two time experience on large appliance was not good, will go for off-store to buy by incurring additional 2k for S9 model but this doesn't add any constraint or resistant to buy any product from amazon in future.Update on October 05,2020:After amazon delivery agency irresponsible service, I was in delimma to order from Croma or Samsung online website and choose to give try to samsung online shop, they miss the customer date commitment by 4 days but the product received is without any dents or damages. Savex from samsung outsource to Delivery agency and they are well equipped with packaging such products refer last pic with packaging which has hard triangular thick cardboard to avoid damages on side, top and bottom with thick adequate safety.Amazon improvement required only on packaging factor, customer commitment by Amazon is awesome and no one can compete in market either online or offline.Ordered and received RT37T4513S8 same price at 34k from samsung website.

Feature rich double door refrigerator with all settings accessible from outside",5.0,"Research is a most important aspect while investing a big amount. I researched well, compared it with other models, both online and in stores, and finally came upon conclusion to buy it. You get nice set of features, including large space, removable ice tray, control panel on the outside, convertible modes, power freeze, power cool etc. Review is after approx 1.5 years of usage.🎁 INSIDE BOX•••••••••••••••••••1x refrigerator1x ice tray4x glass shelves1x vegetable box1x User manual➕ PROS••••••••••••1. Works silently and is a 3 star device. So expect power consumption as per 3 star BEE rating. It hasn't impacted my electricity bills much.2. You get plenty of storage, with 3 glass shelves, one glass shelf/lid for vegetable container, some pockets for bottles and other items along with 2 dedicated egg baskets on door, etc.3. It has a door alarm which is a wonderful feature in my opinion. It reminds us if door is left open for more than 2 minutes. Especially when we miss to close it completely or left open accidentally (happens quite a lot).4. Movable ice maker to adjust space as per desire, or to remove it completely if not needed5. Convertible mode may prove helpful to many, for energy saving or customizing compartments on need basis. Like when on vacation, you could switch off refrigerator if nothings left, and keep only freezer on, or when only a single member at home, use freezer as mini refrigerator and switch off bigger refrigerator if  you have nothing to freeze.➖ CONS••••••••••••1. I personally feel that LED position is a bit off and should have been on the back, or both top and lower back. If fridge is full then with the current arrangement, light won't reach the bottom zones. Those zones are dark and make it difficult to find items there.2. I would prefer light in the freezer as well (not we have cool LED lights available, as opposed to previous gen warm bulbs), but then its something which every manufacturer avoids, considering minimal utility (#of opening refrigerator door vs freezer).Here the cons are personal preferences/observations and not something which are product issues per se.☑ FEATURES & OPERATION•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••1. Convertible mode include 5 combos (upper compartment + lower compartment):Freezer + RefrigeratorRefrigerator + RefrigeratorFreezer off + RefrigeratorFreezer + Refrigerator offFreezer acting as refrigerator + refrigerator off2. Left button is used to set freezer temperature (-23°C to -19°C)3. Right button is used to set refrigerator temperature (1°C to 7°C) and to set it to vacation mode (off)4. Middle button is used to toggle freezer (on/refrigerator mode/off)5. Power freeze (press left button for 3 sec)6. Power cool (press right button for 3 sec)❔ WHY DOUBLE DOOR•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••Double door works good, but comes with a cost. With single door & same capacity you get more space & generally in normal household we dont have many items to be kept in upper ice zone. So that space is kind of wasted.But still its better to settle for double door if cost is not a constraint, as it better organizes content & is efficient. For e.g. if you want ice, you dont need to expose everything to outer environment, which increases temperature & thereby increases load on compressor. Just open upper freezer door and have your ice.Other reason to get double door is it works on forced convection with fans installed for cold air circulation, instead of natural forced convection in single door. In my view its far more efficient for uniform cooling inside. Also, it eliminates need for defrosting freezer chamber (frosting still happens in single door models).✍ FINAL VERDICT••••••••••••••••••••••••It is a recommended product for the capacity and useful features (not the gimmicks).

It really works like a charm!",4.0,"I stay closeby hills and we have rains throughout monsoon and winter seasons. Its wet, cold and damp throughout 8 months of the year, peaking in winters. I had issues with fungus, moulds outside n inside of my wooden shelves, bathrooms and it used to give me triggers of unbearable rhinitis. I have been using this product for one 3 weeks now, and I can see, so far no moulds have appeared and my triggers are less. I am able to sleep thru the night.The cons is -It does not work for 3 months. Its only 3 weeks and my boxes are filled with liquid. So the ones that are in shelves, may stay longer upto 2 months.My tips-For rooms, I have bought the bucket size n placed it near my bed n another tv area. Small ones finishes off too fast.Place it carefully and drain out the liquid carefully onto the toilet.Do not purchase pouches, as they tend to make holes n spill.Invest in reusable box, though the size of the box occupies more space than the rectangular ones.If you keep it close to a fan or a window, then then absorption is very quick. So you may have to replace quickly, so you can slightly move it away.

Little big boy of rotating bowl hand/stand mixers",5.0,"Recently was able to knead 1200 gms of dry flour with a total dough weight of 2.3kgs using a simple trick: Initially mix using beaters with 100% hydration and then use only one kneading hook with a spoon to stop the dough from rising up. Just make sure not to run it too long in one go.While hand mixers are versatile enough, the rotating bowl contraption makes this type of mixers very convenient for hands-free operation. Similar model from Black & Decker did not last the 10 day return window. The Sharp model is better in terms of the Stainless Steel bowl but similar power. This Inalsa model is rated at 500W with 1 min ON/1 min OFF cycle limit specified on the unit. All three use universal motors that make a lot of noise. If you want quiet and reliable operation with better torque, DC motor models are the way to go. Could only find one 250W model from Bajaj and a 450/500W model from Sharp. Unfortunately they are both hand mixers without the rotating bowl. The Bosch model has decent reviews but at 6k+ it is costlier than a 1000W full size planetary mixer!So this model is the winner amongst the aforementioned models for my specific needs. Compared to using the blender in my mixer grinder for cake dough, this mixer does a great job of incorporating a lot of air in the mix.If you intend to bake pizza at home, chances are that your oven temperature is limited to 200-230 deg C. A high hydration dough baked in steps (only base then with tomato paste and finally pre-sauted toppings with cheese) is the way to go. I get good results with the All Purpose Flour (Maida) from the nearby supermarket at 70% to 72% hydration. Mix sparingly with a lot of breaks in between to let the dough autolyse. Once the gluten development starts, it will be more stressful for the motor. The dough is not too sticky right now and can be brought together by mixing with hands in less than 2 mins.With whole wheat, I am able to go as high as 78% without much effort and feels like it can take even more!Please do not use it for roti atta or any other lower hydration dough kneading. I find that the dual mini spirals with rotating bowl works better than the planetary motion with fixed bowl stand mixers (at least the sub 20k models). This is closer to the professional spiral mixers used in professional bakeries in terms of the gentle handling of the dough. Only limitation being the power, continuous run time and dough capacity (less than 1kg dough). Considering that the smallest spiral mixer is around 4kg capacity, occupies a lot of counter space and costs more than 10 times this, it's an obvious choice for light duty home use. Not perfect but good enough for the job. Only wish they come up with a 500W DC motor model. Would be willing to pay 25%-30% more just for the motor technology.

Worth the extra price we pay",5.0,"Read the reviews. I thought I should mention what is not mentioned in other reviews and what you should keep in mind.1) First of all, the 3-pin plug is a big 16-amp plug like the one we see for air conditioners etc. It does not fit the regular 3-pin sockets that we normally find with regular 6-amp in-house switchboards. DO NOT USE ANY 6-AMP TO 16-AMP CONVERTERS. This iron is 2200 watts and draws 10 amps of current. The wiring behind a 6-amp socket in regular household hold switchboards is not capable of carrying 10 amps of current. So, the  wiring behind a 6-amp socket is prone to melt and may cause short circuit, which is dangerous. So, make sure that you connect this iron to a socket which is capable of carrying at least 13 amps of current. Note that this iron may draw more than 10 amps of current if your household supply is more than 220 volts. At my house, the supply from electricity department is usually between 240 and 250 volts. This is the reason I suggest that you use this iron with a 16-amp socket only. The same is true for any appliance which is rated more than 1500 watts.2) For any electric iron with more than 1500 watt rating, ceramic coated sole plate is essential. Ceramic coating is better than other non-stick coatings. Ceramic coating is more scratch resistant and gives a uniform heat distribution and has a higher degree of withstanding higher temperatures than regular non-stick coating. A regular non-stick coating at 200 watts is prone to burn the clothing and makes it difficult to clean the sole plate. This is especially true if your clothes have some kind of letters / logos/ designs printed and if you need to iron such clothes (although it's preferable to press such clothes on the reverse side).3) Saves electricity. Because its 2200 watts, it can heat up instantaneously. Its designed in such a way that it remains auto-shut-off when set aside while you rearrange the garment and it instantly turns ON when you place iron on the garment and supplies heat right away. Also, I noticed that it did retain heat very well when set aside. With my previous electric irons rom Usha (1500 watts with non-stick), it was almost always ON even when set aside while I rearrange the garment. 90% of my clothes are cotton and so I have to use it in max heat setting. Also, I like to press 10 pairs of clothes in a single stretch rather than pressing daily. So, I find this iron box much more easy and quick. Overall, for my needs, this is actually more energy efficient than my other 1500 watt Usha Iron box.At the time of purchasing, I was a little unhappy that I was paying more money than I should. But after using it for couple of months, I am glad that I made the right choice. I purchased it for Rs 2998. Had it been priced around Rs 2500, that would have been great. But I couldn't wait for a deal because my previous iron box (Usha) has gone bad after 10 years of use and I decided to buy a new one rather than getting it repaired. Don't know if this Philips one will last as long as the Usha model lasted, but as of now it is working great.

Convenient and Portable Blender for On-the-Go Nutrition",4.0,"The BlendLife Pro Portable Blender with Sipper is a handy companion for those who prioritize health and convenience, particularly during long trips or travels. While it boasts several notable features, there are some drawbacks to consider before making a purchase.Firstly, the portability of this blender is a standout feature. Its compact design makes it easy to toss into a bag or suitcase, ensuring you can enjoy fresh juices, shakes, or smoothies wherever you go. This aspect alone makes it a valuable asset for frequent travelers or individuals with busy lifestyles.However, the price point of the BlendLife Pro may give some potential buyers pause. While the convenience it offers is undeniable, the cost may be prohibitive for some consumers, especially considering the additional expenses associated with purchasing quality ingredients for blending.Another aspect to consider is the plastic quality of the blender. While functional, it doesn't quite meet the standards of durability that one might expect, particularly given the price. This raises concerns about long-term durability and reliability, especially for those who plan to use the blender frequently.One notable improvement that could enhance the user experience is the addition of a lock mode. As mentioned in other reviews, the absence of a locking mechanism can lead to accidental spills if the blender is inadvertently turned on while in transit. Incorporating a secure locking feature would address this issue and provide users with added peace of mind.In summary, the BlendLife Pro Portable Blender with Sipper offers convenience and versatility for users seeking on-the-go nutrition. While it excels in portability and ease of use, potential buyers should carefully consider the price point and plastic quality before making a decision. Additionally, the absence of a lock mode is a notable drawback that could be addressed in future iterations of the product.

Good product but poor instruction manual",4.0,"PRODUCTLG 7 Kg 5 Star Semi-Automatic Top Loading Washing Machine (P7020NGAZ, Dark Gray, Wind Jet Dry)Delivery date: Oct 23, 2022Purchase cost: Rs.11,490REVIEWThe unit was delivered with the statement that it is 'ready to use' with 'no installation required'. The statement is not fully correct. For people with no familiarity whatsoever with units such as this, assembly of the inlet and outlet pipes and fitting of the lint filter and other accessories can be a little challenging. I had especial problems with the plumbing because I had to purchases a brass adaptor/connector with clamp so that the washing machine inlet pipe could be connected to the wall water supply.[Note: It is not essential to have an inlet pipe for water supply. Water can be poured from a bucket into the wash tub.]The instruction manual and accompanying pamphlet were in print that was so small that I required a magnifying glass to read it and to view details in the figures. The explanations provided were insufficiently clear to understand the purpose and use of all the knobs and settings on the control panel.Assuredly, it's not rocket science, especially to people who have used washing machines before. However, I needed to view youtube videos and use a mixture of guesswork and commonsense at the time of first use. Now, of course, after a trial load of clothes, I am comfortable and happy with the appliance. The wash function, the rinse and spin function, and the spin dry function work smoothly and well. Noise is not excessive. The buzzer to signal the end of the wash cycle is loud. The plastic cover that protects the appliance from falling water from a nearby shower is useful.Because the wash tub is wide, more water is required for the water level to be above the clothes level, and hence more detergent is required for the water to be soapy. So, it is not efficient to use the washing machine with small loads of washing.The wash tub can also be used for rinsing.Moving clothes from the wash tub to the spin dry tub is a small price to pay for the lower cost of a semiautomatic device. However, because the spin dry tub is much smaller than the wash tub, if the quantity of washing is large, one load of washing may need spin drying in 2 or more loads.For users who have a terrace or balcony to dry clothes, the spin dry function is unnecessary (except during the rainy season).With a fully automatic washing machine, the user wastes no time at the machine after loading the clothes, adding the detergent, and keying in the wash settings. With this semiautomatic machine, the user needs to spend additional time in filling and turning off the water for washing; afterwards, in draining and filling water, again, for one or more cycles of rinsing; and afterwards, for one or more cycles of transferring clothes from wash to spin tubs for drying. Busy people might prefer to buy a fully automatic machine.Other notes:1. There are no wheels, but this is not a problem because the machine is reasonably light and can be moved without much difficulty.2. The power cord is only about 2 m long and starts from near the base of the machine, so it needs to be installed close to the wall power point.3. The drain pipe is only about 1.5 m long, so the machine needs to be installed close to where the water can drain.LG should provide more detailed manuals and in larger print, or at least make these available online for download and reference, along with making short videos available at their website for different aspects of assembly, installation, and use.Follow up notes:I have now used the washing machine for about 16 months, at a frequency of about 2-3 times a week.1. I remain happy with the product.2. The filling-washing-draining-rinsing etc steps that need to be manually performed are not a bother. They take up very little time because I do other work in between the steps. So, I have no regrets about having purchased this instead of a fully automatic machine.3. The spin dry function is very useful in the rainy season. It does not fully dry the clothes, but dries them sufficiently so that they can even dry fully on a clothes horse indoors.4. The machine appears to work most efficiently when half (or less) full.5. A wash time of 6-9 min (depending on the load) and a rinse time (in the same tub) of 3 min suffices.6. A spin dry time of 2 min is quite sufficient for a load. This is better than manually squeezing out the water from the clothes.

The steam generated is super strong and more than one may need. It's a life saver if you want to look neat and tidy even while travelling. I am pretty sure that the 800W will not overload the electrical system/wiring in any hotel room. A real value for money product from Havell's considering the quality of material used including the thermostat, a nice ceramic coated soleplate, good quality heat resistant power cable and a 3 pin plug.

1st day review",4.0,"Operating panel is user friendly. Microwave owen works as expected. Full height grab bar is provided for opening the door.Decription on Amazon website says 230 Watts but in reality its a 900 watt microwave owen.Would have liked to have more width and depth rather than lots of height in the cooking cavity, but will suffise for most families. Will update after regular use.

Great use in girls hostel rooms",5.0,"I recently purchased the Orpat HHB-100E 250-Watt Hand Blender, and I must say I am thoroughly impressed with its performance. This compact and lightweight hand blender is a fantastic addition to any kitchen, especially for bachelors like me who are looking for convenience and versatility in their cooking appliances.First and foremost, the build quality of this hand blender is excellent. The white color gives it a sleek and modern look, and the sturdy construction ensures durability. The ergonomic design provides a comfortable grip, making it easy to use for extended periods without causing any strain on the hand.The 250-Watt motor may seem modest, but it delivers ample power for most blending tasks. Whether I'm making smoothies, shakes, or soups, this hand blender handles them effortlessly. The sharp stainless steel blades are efficient and deliver smooth and consistent results every time.What sets the Orpat HHB-100E apart from other hand blenders is its ease of use and cleaning. The detachable blending shaft makes it easy to clean under running water, and the blending jar is also dishwasher-safe. This makes it extremely convenient for a bachelor like me who wants to minimize the time spent on cleaning up after cooking.One of the most useful features of this hand blender is its variable speed control. It allows me to adjust the blending speed based on the ingredients and consistency I want to achieve. Whether I need a quick blend or a slow and steady mix, this hand blender offers precise control.Another handy accessory is the chopper attachment that comes with the blender. It's perfect for chopping small quantities of vegetables, nuts, or herbs, eliminating the need for a separate chopping board and knife, which is a big plus for single folks like me who want to avoid extra kitchen clutter.In conclusion, the Orpat HHB-100E 250-Watt Hand Blender is a fantastic kitchen tool that I highly recommend for bachelor use.

Havells Ventil Air DSP 230mm Exhaust Fan (Choco Brown) (FHVVEMTBRN09),"4.0 out of 5 stars
Efficient exhaust with great suction power and close to noiseless operation",4.0,"I had been looking for exhaust for washrooms and these designs with collapsible flaps looked great considering that it prevents insects and mosquitoes entering via washroom. Having good history with this brands product, I went ahead with the exhaust and with a few minor things it turned out a good decision. One year plus and its still running fine.•••••••••••••••••••🎁 INSIDE BOX•••••••••••••••••••1x exhaust unit1x operating manual4x screws4x nylon sleeve2x rachet screws with square nuts (can be used as an alternative fixing arrangement, either on frame (details below) or to hang it from the top side)Cable length: 55 cm➕ PROS1. Its made of plastic, but have a solid built and motor also looks sturdy.2. Capacitor arrangement is hidden inside a pocket on one of the corners3. Length of attached cable is more than sufficient to reach power point even if above the false ceiling4. Suction is good and 200mm model air flow is sufficient for washroom use case (I have installed these in 8'x5', 9'x6' washrooms)5. Flaps are quite useful, as they prevent insects and mosquitoes when exhaust is not in use6. Noise during operation is on the acceptable side and you wont notice it from other rooms if left on. Its kind of noiseless, if if has unobstructed incoming air flow from some areas in the house.7. Two way fixing arrangement - One may fix it via 4 screws by drilling 4 holes on wall/aluminium frame, or use rachet type screws to avoid drilling holes if the existing arrangement supports the way (possible with modern aluminium window frames with square portion with removable glass reserved for exhaust). I fixed it via rachet screws.➖ CONS1. Flap arrangement is a hit miss kind of, and may be your unit is not that smooth. In one of my exhaust, it is like stuck and opens half way only, unless forced. I tried a replacement but it had the same issue.I had to remove the flap assembly and clear the plastic component (small plastic shaft kind of) which attaches to main body to make flap swivels around.2. Oil collector tray is kind of useless, since there is no ditch around circumferential edge which can collect all of the oil and drip in the tray. Its a design flaw, which may render tray useless.⚙️ ASSEMBLY & INSTALLATION- DIY1. It comes in assembled state but in order to fix it you may need to partially disassemble it2. Design is modular, to most of the pieces are press fit3. Rotate spinner to remove it and subsequently remove the blade4. Remove front panel to reveal holes for screws5. Clear the area of glass and frame, if its there in the exhaust's place6. As your case is, either drill holes on wall/frame marking positions (hole dia will vary accordingly- sleeve thickness for wall and screw thickness for frame) and fix via 4 screws with or w/o nylon sleeves (if fixing to wall nylon sleeve required, and if directly to aluminium frame, screw can be directly used)6. Or use rachet screw on two holes at the center of two sides while attach square nut and if required a bigger washer. Tuck nut and washer to the back side of aluminium frame. Holding it via something, tighten the screw via racket head until it fixes.P.S. Don't tighten any of the plastic nut, spinner, or ring screw beyond a point; otherwise, it may slip. You need to find the threshold intuitively.Also, follow dimension guide in the product images carefully to select the model-150mm version if your space is > 170x170mm and < than 240x240mm200mm version if your space is > 170x170mm and < 290x290mm250mm version if your space is > 290x290mm🏆 VERDICTThis exhaust works great if it has unobstructed incoming air. Remember what goes in comes out, so in order to exhaust volume of air, it will need that volume of incoming air, so somewhere across the home some window or duct must be open to provide that volume. Else it will make noise, since it has to work hard to pull in air from edges of doors and windows.

Reliable and Powerful",5.0,"Title: Reliable and Powerful: A Review of the Havells Ventil Air DX 200mm Exhaust FanI recently purchased the Havells Ventil Air DX 200mm Exhaust Fan for my bathroom, and I couldn't be happier with my decision. This exhaust fan is a game-changer, providing strong air suction, a rust-proof body, and dust protection shutters that make it perfect for any environment.First off, let's talk about the air suction power. It's impressive. This fan effectively removes all unwanted odors and moisture from my bathroom in no time. Even when the room is filled with steam after a hot shower, this exhaust fan quickly clears the air, leaving the space feeling fresh and clean.The rust-proof body is another standout feature. Living in a humid environment, I was worried about the longevity of the fan, but the rust-proof construction gives me peace of mind knowing that it will withstand the test of time.I also appreciate the dust protection shutters. These shutters prevent dust and debris from entering the fan when it's not in use, ensuring that it remains clean and efficient at all times.Installation was a breeze, thanks to the clear instructions provided. The fan is also relatively quiet, which is a plus for a bathroom exhaust fan.Overall, I highly recommend the Havells Ventil Air DX 200mm Exhaust Fan to anyone in need of a reliable and powerful ventilation solution for their bathroom, kitchen, or office. With a 2-year warranty and outstanding performance, it's definitely worth the investment.

All you need to know about this Cooler",5.0,"Some of you might have second opinions based on the variety of reviews you might have encountered for this product. Expectations are good, but one shouldn't expect a Class 6 student to break NEET exam with the existing level of capability the child has. And that's where the low-rated reviews comes in.A few things to consider:1. The Cooler is a 27L one, and it lasts around 12-13 hours in the lowest setting in full tank.2. The cooling is middish and gives a good, cool airflow inside the room. One thing to remember is, that always keep a passage open for the air circulation to take place behind the cooler so that it effectively cools the room.3. If kept for a prolonged time in a closed room, you might encounter a faint humid smell, which is normal for the cooler. And that's why proper ventilation is required.4. Please don't expect a 1.5 ton AC cooling effect from this wee cooler, it's capable on it's own to cool the room but not as much as an AC: both have different mechanisms that they operate in.5. It is a Fan Cooler, not a Blower one. Electricity consumption is much lesser, comparable to that of a Ceiling Fan- and is inverter compatible.6. I drain the cooler tank once in every 2 weeks and clean the blades once a month. It's been pretty good so far.7. The water inlet area is a bit restricted - you might encounter stress on hand-eye coordination while pouring water. You can also add Ice cubes for quick cooling. Also, I pour filter water, not hard water. You can alternatively put a pipe and fill in water, it's completely up to you on how your convenience enables you.8. Noise levels are low. You would feel it is there, but it won't distract you (in the lowest setting). Mid speed, it makes a remarkable, prominent fan noise, since the fan increases it's rotatory speed. In the highest setting, you can encounter a Boeing 747 hissing near you. All with cool air blowing at you in different respective speeds. One thing, when the water level is halfway down, you can hear trickling sounds, of water droplets falling in the tank. The mechanism is such.9. The basic mechanism of the cooler is that the motor pump inside the tank pumps water to the top of the cooler, which would then spread to the honeycomb mats on the side through a regulated water pathway and then trickle down to the tank, while the fan creates a suction cup from the back of the cooler and throws cool air (evaporated) to the front- and it keeps cycling till the water runs out.10. Cooling depends entirely on the kinda of place you live in. Demographics matter if you are buying a cooler- because various factors are in play for cooling to take place. You won't feel much of a cooling effect in places with high humidity and where the temperatures soar up to 41-44 degrees Celsius. Whereas it suits places with a much lesser humidity with temperatures up to 39 degrees.It was effective in my use case, so thought the review might help you decide whether to buy this cooler or go for something that might suit your use case. I just wrote this down since I didn't find any review that completely helps one to make a decision of a purchase.For the price point, it is a very good cooler. I can vouch for that. The wheels are strong too. It is lightweight, and even with the full tank, you can manoeuvre it around pretty easily. Plastic might seem cheap, but is structurally competent.Hope it helps, Cheers!

Hopeless product",1.0,"These new age plastic coolers are really hopeless. They are slightly more than just fan. This product might be good for cooling in moderate tempratures like Bangalore etc. But if you live in areas where temperature touches more around 40 Degree Celsius and above then it is slightly more than a fan. Also, the area of honey comb is so little it doesn't cool at all. I feel my local made cooler is ten times better than these plastic body coolers, their cooling effect is excellent. This cooler is not going to be of any help in hot areas where you have sorching heat. No don't it is light weight, movable and handy but it is not good for what it's actually made for i.e it's cooling. Air throw is good for a 140 sq feet room but cooling is zero and therefore I have given 1 start. Thanks for Amazon's return quality and transparent services, Returning the product.Else it would have been an utter waste of money. If you live in hot areas like Delhi etc, never ever opt for these plastic coolers.They are hopeless.Either go for an a/c or a local made ghas wala cooler. They have better cooling capacity. Thanks

Perfect handy vaccum cleaner",5.0,"I decided on buying this especially for use in the car.  But it is quite handy and charges up in just above 3hrs and can be used for approx 25 to 35 min.  It has pretty good suction power and very easy to use and store also.  I would say it's cheap and best.Cons - The surface area of filter is pretty less so as dust accumulates the suction power reduces a little so you have to upen and take out the filter and tap it gently to let the dust go. Still I recommend it.  I have even shared the link with my close friends.

Not impressed with the purchase",4.0,"The vacuum claims to have a ""powerful motor,"" but it struggles to pick up even basic dirt and debris. I have tried using it on both carpet and hard surfaces with little success.Additionally, the dust collection feature is practically non-existent. Despite multiple uses, the dustbin remains almost completely full after each use. The lighting feature is also fairly useless, as it is not bright enough to be of much use in illuminating the areas being cleaned.Overall, I would not recommend the Swiss Military VC03 Wireless Car Vacuum Cleaner. It is a poor performer and does not live up to its claims. There are much better options available on the market for car vacuum cleaners.

"KENT 16053 Egg Boiler-W 360 Watts | Stainless Steel Heating Plate | 3 Boiling Modes - Hard, Medium, Soft Eggs| Boils Upto ...","5.0 out of 5 stars
Superlative quality and performance!!",5.0,"This is a kind of product which is in a league of it's own. It does not have any competitors in the online market and neither in the offline market. It was very easy for me to choose this egg boiler since the reviews were amazing and the price was extremely reasonable. It is better that I talk about the working of the egg boiler rather than comparing it with other products. The best thing about this Kent egg boiler is that it is EASY TO USE( I wish I could highlight this even more to express how easy to use it really is). You just have to follow 3 simple steps to give a healthy kickstart to your day:1) Place as many eggs as you want(1-7) onto the plastic egg rack of the boiler.2) Measure the amount of water(the water measuring plastic beaker is calibrated into Soft, Medium and Hard categories with each category further divided into 1,2,3,4,5 and 6&7 subcategories according to the number of eggs you want to boil) and pour it directly into the metal plate of the boiler.3) Push the power button and relax.The auto cut-off feature will automatically switch the power off preventing your eggs from becoming too hard or bursting open. However, if you leave the boiled eggs in the boiler for too long then the power will turn on again until all the water evaporates.Another important thing which makes this egg boiler a must have is the ease with which it can be cleaned. Usually egg is a kind of thing which comes with an obnoxious smell which must be gotten rid of and hence, cleaning after every usage becomes necessary ( if you don't find the aftersmell of eggs offensive then you can surely use it over and over again without cleaning). Earlier I though that the heating plate cannot be wiped with a wet cloth but one day when I cleaned the plate with a moist cloth I realised that it is not a problem at all. This goes to show the high DURABILITY of the product. I am using this product for the last 5 months and I have not faced a single issue till now.Last but not the least, the value for money quotient of this product is extremely high. If you can get a total solution of your daily requirement at such a low price then it is totally worth it. Needless to say but the assurance of a brand like Kent gives that extra confidence to the customer to buy this product.

 It's solid construction. The provided egg piercer is essential, since my experience of egg boilers is that eggs tend to crack and spill making a mess. With the egg piercer, not even a single egg has cracked so far  !! It DOES require some skill to pierce - the trick is to hold the egg firmly and apply slow but firm pressure on the broad end until it pierces.Also provided is a water measuring 'cup' which has clearly marked gradings on the side - for soft/medium/ hard, and depending on how many eggs you are boiling at a time.Earlier boilers I would have to experiment with the amount of water and make my own markings.The hard boil typically takes around 6-7 minutes to boil. Then it auto switchs off. BUT YOU MUST SWITCH OFF FROM MAIN SWITCH, otherwise itll come back on after a while.It looks really smart in my kitchen  !One main downside is that you have to be extra careful when removing the lid - the handles (on the sides) are small and get a little hot. But you have to watch out for any residual steam when opening  !!  Some design improvement could be done here.Also provided is a small dish for steaming, but i haven't used that as yet.

So, it may be a little premature to write realistic review on its performance. Appearance of the unit is good. I got it just before Diwali. So, I got a good deal. 6kg unit is adequate for a couple or a small family. Performancewise it is a bit noisy. Yesterday morning the machine stopped working. I called support and by noon it was fixed. Great service! While the issue is being fixed, I had a chance to look inside the machine. The quality of inner components appears to be good. The issue was with a multi wire connector assembly. I do not know if it was common problem with other machines. But the technician had a spare. Now, the machine is running with only a few hours of down time. So far so good.

One of the best appliances in Kitchen",4.0,"The root cause to buy this was a East_UP/Bihari dish, Litti-Chokha. And, after successfully cooking our family favourite dish, we are so happy that even if it doesn't do anything else will not matter for us.Performance of the appliance is upto the mark of brand name for anything it is supposed to do. We've tried our hand on so many non conventional dishes and it hasn't disappointed us in any of our extravagant Adventures.For small things like quickly heating milk for kid, heating Roti or even Bhaat-Daal, it's very convenient by saving lots of time which we generally spend staring into pan/utensil kept on gas stove.Thank you Samsung!!!

Did a lot of research before buying this and trust me this is the best and most balanced product, you can do normal aswell as microwave cooking. Right features and capacity.

10 years warranty is a gimmick",5.0,"Brand is providing 10 years warranty on the Enamel cavity. But in case it gets affected by rusting (which happened for my case after using 2 years) service center will be denying any replacement or repair saying cavity can't be changed and as per policy will try to give a hugely depreciated amount based on year of purchase (safe to say 70-80% value will be deducted at-least). Buy the equipment for it's good features, but advisable to go for a Steel cavity.

"TATA Swach Steel Gravity Water Purifier, 20L (10L+10L)","5.0 out of 5 stars
Good water filter",5.0,"The assembly of the water filter is super easy. Water quality appears to be good.For the assembly, key point is that the filter has to be soaked in water for a few hours after opening the seal. I missed reading this in the instructions. The instruction booklet really needs to be made better.Post assembly, and filling up of water found no water getting filtered, even after a day,  and thought I'd received a faulty one. Reached out to the seller, the seller supported immediately over whatsapp - sent videos and a note that the seal has to removed on the filter. This is a tiny plastic sticker on one end of the filter.The filter storage tanks is made of thin SS steel - wouldn't rate it a great, but does the job. The external surface is a bit grainy, so chances of getting salt stains due to splattered water is higher. The chambers don't fit very snugly, which is good, since it make cleaning easier.Also, having muddy water with heavy usage may mean frequent cleaning - since they recommend reverse pumping the filter to unclog it. I haven't done it till now, since our usage is quite low and we get fairly clean water.Water filtration rate is comparable to pureit, the water had a slightly chlorine like taste initially, which is not present now (or we have gotten accustomed to it).We went for this, specifically to avoid plastic storage tanks and did not want a RO. This was the best - reputed - option we found.The seller was extremely helpful and responded immediately on raising a query.

Use about 3 to 4 litres as the first filter batch of water, and this is to be discarded. Once done, you are good to go. Purchased it because I wanted to avoid plastic water filters, bottles and storage containers. Yes the filter candle is also plastic, but that is kind of unaviodable. To compensate for that I place a copper sheet or copper tumbler in the lower chamber.Only drawback is the tap is plastic.

 Review After Using It For 6 Months:-This is my very first smart home electrical. The fan runs great (Obviously It Should). Had a small problem with the app. Was resolved after an app update. Remote works fine. Yes, it considerably saves some electricity without any doubts as I have personally verified it by checking my electricity bills. I have bought 2 of these & I have installed them in my bedroom & living room.Customer care support is very good. Remember to register your product as soon as you purchase it as it gives you one additional year of warranty along with the standard 2 year warranty.Fan runs smoothly & does not create any wierd sounds. Regular maintanence is required. Works seamlessly with alexa & google assistant. I will recommend this product without any second thoughts.Yes it is very expensive for a ceiling fan but is worth it. If you can extend your budget a little bit, try getting the wooden finish variant as it will look more premium & unique.Thanks Atomberg for such a quality product & thanks Amazon for the great packaging & seamless delivery experience.

A good product with promise! One can surely buy this.",4.0,"The fan has been in use for just a little over a month. Mostly, I have been very happy with this product.Here are some observations:A. The positives:1- it's super easy to install, as there are just two wires (phase in, neutral out) to handle in the motor, and the rest of the process is illustrated stepwise and diagrammatically on the package box as well as the instruction manual.2- The precautions being asked by the manufacturer MUST be adhered to for the best performance from the product. Three things are asked clearly:•bypassing the usual external speed-regulator fixed on the switchboard. (The fan has it's own advanced speed control inside the motor assembly, it needs full power input at all times to function normally, it is still designed to consume less than half the power of a conventional ceiling fan.)• fixing of the fan's down-pipe ceiling-end assembly directly and firmly to the ceiling, without any intervening 'S' type suspender, etc.• fixing of the fan has to be firm, all nuts used need proper tightening (or it can be a safety hazard if any fan ran nuts!)3- the functions work just as claimed by the manufacturer, and they are a clear value-addition to this fan.The remote control is super; Innovative LED function as a fx. indicator and night light is neat (like many other users have already noticed, it would be great if they changed the hue to yellow-lamp one in night-light mode, this will be a slick utility addition to the product); timer is again a great utility and so is the sleep fx. specially in colder regions or such areas/weather where temperature drops after midnight.Antidust paint does help somewhat. After a month there is just a little hint of dust on the edges of the blades (again regular cleaning has to be done as per directions of the manufacturer for product life and performance)4- Mostly, if the fan works perfectly, the only noise audible is that of the shearing and driving of air down as it revolves. So it's motor makes no humm that's audible on the ground. Just the air being channelled through the blades, can be heard. And that sound will increase as the speed will increase. If a room has echo effect in it, it may sound a bit high. So, the fan motor in and of itself, does not seem to be making noise.5- the circuitry operating voltage range is also great, which is really a plus if one lives in poorly regulated inline voltage with frequent fluctuations. It works fluently while everything around stutters to the whims of those unpredictable and uncontrollable changes.6- the fan speeds are very properly scaled. That alone will make it so useful in most parts of India where celing fan is required (that means everywhere nowadays, even in Himalayan regions!)7. Airflow is just great. Another careful design change to the blades can widen it further outward. Presently, its strong vertically underneath the motor, and moving away from the range of the blade, there is a palpable drop in air flow. This happens in most fans. There is air at the edges of the room to be comfortable, but one wishes it were more.So it's about taking the same the airflow and rendering the distribution directionally even. It's still great as it is. And I think the next version of this fan will only optimise the radial flow  coming out of the edges.(To address both the air flow noise and radial-out air-flow towards the edges, considering a 1400mm blade version may help. It will take down rpm to reduce airthrow noise while retaining/bettering the airflow volume but will also provide more blade surface area to work with air flow distribution profile. Just a thought.)8. It's design is novel! Very few fans will come close to it there as well.Overall, on the positive side this is a good value product. And more value can still be added to it. So there is a future surity built into the concept of this fan which makes the purchase really worthwhile.Kudos to the Atomberg team for creating such sleek and slick beauty!B. Now that this is a sure fire winner, let's look at aspects to work on:i. The 'click' sound being reported is gradually noticable on my unit as well, and there is also a vibrating/fluttering sound from the blades. I suspect the 'rivets' on the blades need another look. Especially as there is a slight wobble no matter how good the fix to the ceiling is. So that is a worry as it unnecessarily confuses many users on an otherwise great product.ii. The website needs to show product purchases made from any site as soon as a user registers for an Atomberg a/c and provides a legitimate unit-number no matter what source it was purchased from. That will be the best professional practice. If there is a genuine proof of purchase recognised by Atomberg, then that unit's purchase upon creating an a/c on website and registering the serial no. needs to be acknowledged in the users Atomberg product ownership page.iii. I haven't yet asked for customer care assistance but this is again a worry till now. How to get the issued resolved locally. There's a customer care number. But how will actual support be provided at my location, it still has to be looked into.I am keeping best expectations from Atomberg.I think this product is a winner. Now it's a matter of refining and enhancing its performance to perfection.

Good product, but excellent service",5.0,"Note - I am an Electronics and Instrumentation Engineer. You'll know why I gave 5 stars at the endI purchased the fan in March 2021, and am writing the review in Feb 2024. So yeah, I waited 3 years to accurately write the long-term usage review. It worked well for the initial 2 months, but some weird noise started coming at no.4 and no.5 speeds. Complained about it instead of checking it myself cuz it was under a 3-year warranty. They sent a technician, who opened the motor-coil assembly and did something (mostly cleaning) that fixed the noise issue. I noticed a bent washer in one of the joints but did not say anything cuz the noise was gone.But as I expected, the noise showed up again after about 3 months. I called the support again, and this time the technician accurately located the error. I appreciate this one because instead of taking a long time to fix it, he replaced the washer and the motor coil assembly. I checked it by myself and found no physical or visible error. The fan did not make those weird noises for a long time now. However, the company CEO or Owner or maybe some high-ranking dude sent an apology letter and an email that I never expected. It was a great gesture.However, a new issue started showing up where the fan could not catch up to speed beyond no.4, and that too during peak summers in 2023. I checked the warranty and called them up again. The technician followed the general protocols of rebooting the fan's software if there was a technical soft glitch. Thankfully it was gone within seconds. Till now it has been working well. But 2024 summers are coming so I hope the thing continues working well.Last note - I appreciate the entrepreneurship spirit of India's young boys. I faced so many issues cuz being an engineer myself, I understand that R&D takes time and we learn from mistakes. I will support the company cuz they admitted the issues, and fixed them, and I'm sure they are keeping a record of all these problems for future R&D purposes to make their products even better. Wishing luck to the company and hope that they increase their scale of manufacturing in India from scratch gradually over time, just in case they are importing chip-level components from PRC, like many other companies, which I understand.

Value for money but not for peak Delhi pollution",4.0,"I have 3 of these in my home. And these are very effective throughout the year to keep the house clean and protect us from infections (lesser colds in the household and even if one person contracts it doesn't spread to others). We are sleeping more peacefully at night and allergic ailments have gone down.However, when Delhi becomes a gas chamber October last week and November first week (beyond 999 at unmeasurable levels), these purifiers struggle. They are able to bring down to within 100, which is good, but, not in the good range of <30. I have an infant who is struggling these days because of these elevated levels and the unfortunate fact that PM below 1.0 is also high in Delhi this winter. These purifiers operate till PM 2.5. I will have to try some other brands with more powerful purifiers given the rapidly deteriorating condition in our city.

6 year usage review Gurgaon",5.0,"I purchased this purifier on the 27th of Dec, 2017, our 2nd day in Gurgaon (we relocated from Pune). We used to stay on MG Road and it took all night for the air purifier to turn from Red To Pink, it never turned Blue. We relocated to Sohna Road within 2 months, during that time the flyover construction was going on in Sohna Road, so there was a lot of dust. After all night usage, the purifier used to turn blue in the morning. So we relocated again, to Sector 83. Here it has been blue ever since we moved :) so, we stopped using. However, during winters we need to use it.  This year (early November, went AQI goes out of the window) when we turn it on, the reading is about 78-80 initially, then drops to single digit in 20 mins. Our apartment is bigger than average Delhi apartment rooms. This works well in the living room too.In the last 6 years, we haven’t faced and trouble with Maintainance, the filters are economical and easily available.My observation is that if you live in Delhi or heart of Gurgaon, do not expect it to work wonders for you. You may try using more than 1 purifier and see if that helps.For us, it’s absolutely what we need.

Amazing product does what it says. .",5.0,"Short review - It works, the PM meter is accurate, lowers the pm 2.5 considerably, less allergies, less mucous, less naval congestion. .great product.Long review- This review is for serious buyers only and its gonna be long so read only if u want a true opinion about the product.I ordered it 15 days back, got the delivery and have now used it for over 10 days. I can say with full conviction that the product is awesome. It does what it says that is purifies the air.I was having running nose as a constant reality of my life for the past 2 -3 years, i live in delhi. Initially it used to be only in winters, but than i realized even in Summers i was having constant nasal congestion, mucus formation and running nose. I was using upto 10 napkins a day for blowing my nose(funny but tiring!). Anywaz recently i realized even my young daughter waa having recurring running nose.I gave it lot of consideration and came to the conclusion that the ol boy is fine inside, it has to be the pollution. Did a lot of research and finally ordered this mean machine.Within 1 night of using the napking usage for blowing nose was restricted to 1 a day. .after 3 days it became none. Not even one i have touched in past 7 days.So its either some magic or this product and i am gonna go with the later. Even an 8 hour night usage maybe gives the body time to recover cause no musus and all even in day is forming. I am sure it works on allergies also, even though its not written.Further pros are sleep mode, u would not even know it on its so silent and light also turn off. When electricity cut happens it turns on as soon as power comes back.Now coming to cons there are 3 cons.1. No child lock.2. Dries the air a bit(i use wet towel as suggested by other user).3. No wall mounting (maybe cause its a heavy product).Rest all is great, i must say use it if u r living in a polluted city like delhi, mumbai etc.Value for money. .Edit after 6 months plus usage - does what it says BUT the filter is very expensive, also starts giving very bad odour within 2 months of usage and than spend 3000 again to buy filters. .its like a recharge every 2 months. .but works well thats fr sure. .

Good for air purification",5.0,"This air purifier is from Philips brand. Its a good brand so i decided to buy itFirst product i got was making some rattling noise while running at low speed which was annoying at night although it was low bit i got very easy replacement from amazon. The second unit i received is completely fine.The good things about this product is it has a PM 2.5 meter and in presense of any smoke or kitchen smoke or outdoor smoke it start to rise and increases the speed of the unit automatically in Auto mode which is very good feature. Since the time i purchase it i cant smell any outdoor smoke smell i use to get before. In auto mode low pm 2.5 levels it runs very silently that u get no sound as soon as it detects smoke it speeds up so at night u can sleep without any disturbance.I have pollen allergy in rainy season and if i sleep at night with this machine on i get no allergies symptoms in the morning after waking up as these machines are efficient in removing anything that is in the air so that your room is free of pollens or particulates. I keep the room closed with 4-5 inches of sliding window open for fresh air.I would recommend this for people with allergies.Opening and changing filters is very very easy so no hassles in maintenance.The product looks very beautiful.I would recommend to anyone if you or your family members have dust or pollen allergies.

Worst experience",1.0,"Did not expect this type of 3rd class quality from whirlpool. I used this ac for only 4 months and in the next season the coil was leaked from 9 points i had to change the whole coil and also the display stops after 3 months .

It could not be any better",5.0,"Reviewing after 1 month use.First of all, got it on an amazing price of 24k including 1000/- HDFC discount. Used no cost EMI option and splitted the cost into 6 easy emi (otherwise had to wait for a month or two to save required amount).Pros:1. fast cooling2. Zero noise3. Nice advance features like near me, I control, sleep mode etc4. Competetive price5. Got it on time6. Newely manufactured price without any scratch. Kudos to Amazon and especially the sellerCons:Sometime the remote doesn't work in single click. Have to change my angel and try a several times. However this happens 2/10 times so I am ok with this assuming this happens to other AC also.Go fir it if it's still available in 24K

Good for the price.",3.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The AC is good for the price range. I've a smaller room 130sqft but my room gets lot of Sun and hence is very hot. The AC cools the room down very quickly and is surprisingly silent. Even on Turbo mode the Sound level is around 50dB and normally around 40dB. 6th sense mode and Convertible mode works great. (5/5)The remote sensitivity could have been better it doesn't recognise anything unless you point directly at the AC.It's also not backlit so it's difficult during night. (3/5)The installation part was the only bad experience they charged me total Rs.2,250 including the Stand. They did not accept online transfer only cash (Really fishy). Amazon has mentioned 1500+taxes. They didn't have necessary equipments like extention wires for drilling outdoor unit which had to be arranged by me and Plug Tops. They were super late and made me wait from morning to almost evening. (2/5)Final verdict : Other than above mentioned issues the AC is value for money and REALLY cools. Recommended 👍🏻Will check the performance for a month and update again.Edit 1 Year : The AC is still running awesome. Cools well. The quality of external pipe covers are not good after weather exposure the external pipe covers just dissolved away. Very bad. Reducing 1 star because of that.

"Bajaj DMH 90 Neo 90L Desert Air Cooler for home with DuraMarine Pump (2-Yr Warranty), Antibacterial Honeycomb Pads, Powerf...","5.0 out of 5 stars
Decent product!",5.0,"Hi everyone,I have bought a Bajaj Neo 65L model and have received it by Amazon in just 2 days. I am writing this review just after one use of the air cooler. So firstly, when I received the box it seems  to be a little old condition but after unboxing the product the cooler was packed completely with cover and thermo sheet with decent quality. On box I noticed that cooler manufacturing date, which was 02/2024. It means the cooler was new and just 2 months old. Now let's talk about pro and cons. The one more thing that in this price range and brand won't get much in market. So I would suggest to go for it and use it as per your requirement.Pro: Yeah as per the details mentioned the fan power is powerful and at 1st point only throws good air, so if your room is 250-350 sqft area then it is more than enough. If you want to have huge then you may go for 90L. But this 65L looks big size and have wheels that can be attached to it for easy movement. The 4 castor wheels come in packaging which are inside the ice chamber of the top hood. The air flow is decent and doesn't seem any problem while using for first time. I hope at the 3rd speed won't be using much because the air flow is decent in at 1st low level.Cons:The horizontal vents which used to adjust air flow seem to be little hard to make it up/down because it has to do manually and it won't close completely incase the cooler is not for use, So might be chances that flies/mosquito may enter through it.Another thing that the water drain is at bottom and difficult to pull the knob, where if you want to remove any stagnant water remaining. So you may need an sponge or any good cloth to clean and space inside the cooler is very less, hardly your hand will reach any part inside. An healthy adult hand may not be reachable if want to clean inside the cooler.The adjustable knobs at top looks okay but speed of fan knob has the 3 speed control in which at first is top speed and then goes for 2nd & 1st. I don't know why Bajaj company have given that adjustable controls. Because most of the air cooler controls start from 1st then increas the level of speed.So this are all my observations over the air cooler but still try to use further and then could decide about its working and may give another review. But as per the budget and quality point of view it is best cooler. There is no any other air cooler in market at this price range. So if you are still concerned about the price then would suggest to visit your nearest store and compare the units that fit your room. Because in images it might be difficult to judge.Thank you Amazon,Happy Shopping!

Reasonably acceptable appliance",4.0,"Performs as described.Water consumption for 3-4 hours is 15-20 ltrs.Noise is on the higher side.The air flow is good.Cooling is moderate without ice.Slight damage to the plastic near the wheels may be due to the transporting.Got a latest batch stock (~2 months).After i ordered this, it went out of stock, i was vary of whether it is a old or used stock, but it was not. It was packed by properly.Big downside of the cooler is uneven water distribution to the honeycomb pads and very difficult to remove reserve water in the tank, drain plug is situated in the bottom and it is very inconvenient.Quality of the drain plug is very poor.Plastic quality of the appliance is pretty poor.The cooler moves by itself due to functioning.Control knobs for swing, fan, pump is poor.Fan speed starts from 3 after it is power, which means it is logically designed poorly.Overall Bajaj or the third party manufacturer has to improve on the quality of knobs, even distribution of the water to the complete honeycomb pads, more rugged quality plastic, better side placement of the drain plug. Proper water level indication including the reserve capacity.

Good cooler",4.0,"It's a good cooler. I'll summarise it as below:Pros-- can work continuously for hours together without trouble-- gives good level of cooling-- is easy to move & fill-- looks nice-- filling it fully once is sufficient for 6-8 hrs of useCons-- After a few weeks I am seeing something of a leak at the bottom. It's only minor but still, not expected.-- The castors have to be fitted by the customer. This is idiotic & it's very difficult to do alone.-- the ice tray doesn't serve any purpose. The hole is too small-- the sequence of fan speed on the knob should be 1, 2, 3. Not 3, 2, 1.Overall worth the price & a great relief in the horrifying summer.

Overall good value for money.",3.0,"I found this cooler much useful for me. I'm happy for the money I spent on this cooler. few Cons I notice with this cooler.- there is no lock in castor wheel causing cooler to move sometimes.- Ice chamber is somewhat 1 liter capacity.  for 90 liters water capacity, 1 liter ice doesn't make any sense.- cooler deflectors doesn't close completely. concerning accumulation of dust or mosquito breading when not in use.- auto swing deflectors are positioned closer to fan. thus, air deflection angle is less then compared to other brand coolers.- colling pads has no mosquito net towards outer side. again, concerning accumulation of dust or mosquito breading when not in use.- control nobs are somewhat wobbly.- power cord is small in length.pros:- fan is fast enough for the given Moter wattage.- fan is of plastic causing lesser load on Moter during operational.- operational sound is ok for me.- water pump is of superior quality.- back cooling pad is closer to fan, causing air suction effect from back side.- power cables and internal water pipe quality is superior.- cooling pads are well positioned there is no water leak/flow to outside from cooling pads when pump is on.- cooler size is slim compared with other brands in same category.other suggestions- product capability can be increased by added timer functionality for pump, fan speed etc.

They said technician will visit soon. After 2 days technician visit and told me its PCB is damaged and need to be replaced. But it will take 4-5 days because they have to place request with company.After 5 days no one came to fix the PCB. I contacted customer support again and they provided me contact number of local service center. Customer support said now I need to contact the local service center only and they can't do anything in my case.I contacted the local service center and they told me that the order is already placed for my PCB and now they also can't do anything.Even after 15 days when part never arrived Local service manager gave me a phone number of the inventory manager.That guy was very rude and don't even have manners to talk. Said they will dispatch the part soon.Now if you can wait for 20-30 days for service then its okay or otherwise I'll suggest you go for some other brand because the service of Orient is Pathetic. The fan is very essential during summer time. Choose wisely.I thought Orient is a trusted brand but now I realize I made a horrible mistake.

 Like: High speed fan with great looks and very light weight.Remote works fine but has to be pointed towards the fan. Air delivery is ok but never comparable with older fans. BLDC fans have different blade profile for energy efficiency which a slight sacrifice for lower operating cost.Dislike: Very poor customer service from Orient.Free installation not done and I installed it locally. Amazon had promised a reimbursement of Rs 200 which I am yet to receive even after 4 days.Very high noise level at speed 4 and 5 due to its high speed.Air delivery is concentrated and does not spread beyond 4-5 ft diameter.Update after 10 days use: The noise has reduced considerably and is now comparable with my old fans. Must have been from newly lubricated bearings. Speed is very fast and air flow has increased to normal .Bought three more fans in great Indian festival. There are many complain of high running noise. As per my experience this noise comes from freshly lubricated fan bearings which go away after seven days. So please do not return by the shrilling noise for first few days.Air delivery now appear to be comparable with my old fans at full speed.Energy consumption is one third which is a great advantage considering twenty hors running time per day for 8 months at Kolkata.

Will review again after using the appliance for wet cleaning.Having researched for many cleaning appliances, I feel this is best for the price that it is offered😊The company’s online demo is good but, a live demo would be better!

Good Device",5.0,"The device is performing as per the advertisement. The best thing is its light weight and the suction power is also adequate. The online demo given by Ms Ritu was also informative which covered all of the doubts we carry. Only thing is that purchase washable and re useable dry bag seperately. What eureka forbes provides is a one time time bag which once installed will work upto 2 kg of dust. Once it reaches there after multiple uses, better to keep another bag handy to get it replaced. All good from my side. Have not used the wet suction yet. So unable to comment on that.

Awesome budget Cooler for 2-3ppl and small room",5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Awesome product with decent cooling if cross ventilation is provided.Pros: 5star build quality* Great fit and finish* Budget friendly* Good air throw* Decent cooling*Honey comb mesh* Less noiseCons some minor cons such as no ice chamber and average quality internal pipes n small water inlet chamber.Overall loved the product it's best for small rooms with 2-3 PPL and 35-39°c and low humidity. I previously had a dessert cooler which had poor fit and finish also used to make very loud noise and due to which I could not sleep. This on other hand is less noise and decent cooling the back panel screws were too tight i loosed then from inside now it's easy to open and add water from the rear window. I tried a small hack where I froze3-4 1ltr bottles in fridge and put them in the cooler for more cool air. This works only til the ice melts. Highly recommend this for a small room with good cross ventilation. If needed add an exhaust fan to avoid humidity. Cheers

A Game-Changer for Hot Summer Days!",5.0,"I've been using the Bajaj PX 97 TORQUE (HC) 36L Personal Air Cooler for a few weeks now, and it has truly transformed my summer experience. The combination of honeycomb pads and turbo fan technology provides a refreshing and powerful cooling effect, making even the hottest days bearable.The 36L capacity is perfect for my bedroom, ensuring that it runs for extended periods without needing constant refills. The air throw is impressive, reaching every corner of the room with ease. I particularly appreciate the 3-speed control feature, allowing me to adjust the cooling to my preference.The design is sleek and modern, fitting well with my home decor. Additionally, it's relatively quiet, which is a huge plus for light sleepers like myself. Setting it up was straightforward, and the wheels make it easy to move around as needed.Overall, the Bajaj PX 97 TORQUE has exceeded my expectations. It’s an excellent investment for anyone looking to stay cool during the summer without the high costs of an air conditioner. Highly recommended!

Good Cooler Under 6K",5.0,"Got the product for a good deal. Some of the Pro's and Con's mentioned below -PROs -1) Sturdy build quality and looks trendy2) The cooling for a 15x10 room is sufficient. Good air throw and with three sides honeycomb inflow, the air is cooler even at ambient temperatures of upto 39* C3) Multiple speed options to control from.4) Dedicated knob to control swing and water pump activation.5) Swing function very nicely designed where-in the air flow is continuously thrown in the direction its facing plus the swing module which throws burst of air as and when it passes along. Its not the typical swing of other aircoolers or pedastal fan where-in there is a gap of ""no-air flow"" when its swinging.CONs -1) The sound of air cooler, to be frank its manageable and I'm nit-picking here as there is no air-cooler in market which is sound less.2) No remote control option available, I have 10+year old Kenstar cooler at home which has a remote control.3) No timer option to set to run the air-cooler for specific number of hours and auto turn off.4) When using with water circulation enabled, the sound of air-cooler increases as the water that is made to come via the honeycomb pads are dripped off from bottom directly into the water reservoir. When I compare it with my old Kenstar cooler, it had a separate tube that would silently drain water from the honeycomb pads back to reservoir which drastically reduced noise. But again Bajaj having a motor with fan option compared to my Kenstar with blower option generates less noise overall so I'm satisfied.Considering the above and if you have a dealbreaker for any of the Cons, I will recommend the product.

"Symphony Ice Cube 27 Personal Air Cooler for Home with Powerful Fan, 3-Side Honeycomb Pads, i-Pure Technology and Low Powe...","5.0 out of 5 stars
All you need to know about this Cooler",5.0,"Some of you might have second opinions based on the variety of reviews you might have encountered for this product. Expectations are good, but one shouldn't expect a Class 6 student to break NEET exam with the existing level of capability the child has. And that's where the low-rated reviews comes in.A few things to consider:1. The Cooler is a 27L one, and it lasts around 12-13 hours in the lowest setting in full tank.2. The cooling is middish and gives a good, cool airflow inside the room. One thing to remember is, that always keep a passage open for the air circulation to take place behind the cooler so that it effectively cools the room.3. If kept for a prolonged time in a closed room, you might encounter a faint humid smell, which is normal for the cooler. And that's why proper ventilation is required.4. Please don't expect a 1.5 ton AC cooling effect from this wee cooler, it's capable on it's own to cool the room but not as much as an AC: both have different mechanisms that they operate in.5. It is a Fan Cooler, not a Blower one. Electricity consumption is much lesser, comparable to that of a Ceiling Fan- and is inverter compatible.6. I drain the cooler tank once in every 2 weeks and clean the blades once a month. It's been pretty good so far.7. The water inlet area is a bit restricted - you might encounter stress on hand-eye coordination while pouring water. You can also add Ice cubes for quick cooling. Also, I pour filter water, not hard water. You can alternatively put a pipe and fill in water, it's completely up to you on how your convenience enables you.8. Noise levels are low. You would feel it is there, but it won't distract you (in the lowest setting). Mid speed, it makes a remarkable, prominent fan noise, since the fan increases it's rotatory speed. In the highest setting, you can encounter a Boeing 747 hissing near you. All with cool air blowing at you in different respective speeds. One thing, when the water level is halfway down, you can hear trickling sounds, of water droplets falling in the tank. The mechanism is such.9. The basic mechanism of the cooler is that the motor pump inside the tank pumps water to the top of the cooler, which would then spread to the honeycomb mats on the side through a regulated water pathway and then trickle down to the tank, while the fan creates a suction cup from the back of the cooler and throws cool air (evaporated) to the front- and it keeps cycling till the water runs out.10. Cooling depends entirely on the kinda of place you live in. Demographics matter if you are buying a cooler- because various factors are in play for cooling to take place. You won't feel much of a cooling effect in places with high humidity and where the temperatures soar up to 41-44 degrees Celsius. Whereas it suits places with a much lesser humidity with temperatures up to 39 degrees.It was effective in my use case, so thought the review might help you decide whether to buy this cooler or go for something that might suit your use case. I just wrote this down since I didn't find any review that completely helps one to make a decision of a purchase.For the price point, it is a very good cooler. I can vouch for that. The wheels are strong too. It is lightweight, and even with the full tank, you can manoeuvre it around pretty easily. Plastic might seem cheap, but is structurally competent.Hope it helps, Cheers!

Hopeless product",1.0,"These new age plastic coolers are really hopeless. They are slightly more than just fan. This product might be good for cooling in moderate tempratures like Bangalore etc. But if you live in areas where temperature touches more around 40 Degree Celsius and above then it is slightly more than a fan. Also, the area of honey comb is so little it doesn't cool at all. I feel my local made cooler is ten times better than these plastic body coolers, their cooling effect is excellent. This cooler is not going to be of any help in hot areas where you have sorching heat. No don't it is light weight, movable and handy but it is not good for what it's actually made for i.e it's cooling. Air throw is good for a 140 sq feet room but cooling is zero and therefore I have given 1 start. Thanks for Amazon's return quality and transparent services, Returning the product.Else it would have been an utter waste of money. If you live in hot areas like Delhi etc, never ever opt for these plastic coolers.They are hopeless.Either go for an a/c or a local made ghas wala cooler. They have better cooling capacity. Thanks

In July they sent a technician who was adamant that the cooling is fine. After much pusuation he agreed that it was not cooling and said that installation was faulty and gas was leaking. He filled up the gas and assured that it will be ok. Again in September, AC stopped cooling. Same complaint booking, technician visit and gas leak fixed. 3rd time in October AC has stopped cooling. Again I complained, technician visit and gas leakage problem.Again in June,2024 same problem of cooling. Again I complained now they are saying compressor defective. Now more than 7 days they have not yet changed that part. also. I am tired of all this. I want refund of my money. Seems like buying lloyd AC that too from Amazon was my biggest mistake. I have bought it online that is why a faulty product has been given. Had I bought it from a nearby store, I wouldn't have to face so many problems. Return period is over and now there is no liability of seller. BEWARE CUSTOMERS!!

The product quality is decent",1.0,"Overall service was really disappointing from Lloyd .My Honest review - I purchased AC from amazon on 12th April2023. The day when AC installation team came to my home, they haven't told me how much cables and other stuff they are going to need, and they installed it with not in corrected way and without prior discussion they asked me 3000rs. I don't had any option because they told me if I don't pay 3000, they will uninstall everything and they will go. This was incident 1. Now lets talk about incident 2 , On 2nd April 2024 I managed somehow to Transport AC to Another home without gas leakage.  Therafter I raised a service request within warranty period to install AC. Then AC technician came, and he refused to install AC without payment. As it was under warranty then I was supposed to get free installation. Thereafter I raised another service ticket but LLOYD rejected my ticket based on the fact that service is in outer area bla bla bla. I raised 3 tickets with valid points but they rejected on their end without proper reason. Another thing is they told me AC gas filling under warranty is free and I have validated this fact on LLOYD Website. But technician suggested me to pay 2700(2200 for gas + 500 service charges) though everything was in warranty period. Therafter LLoyd deliberately bought some time and my warranty on 12Apri 2024 got finished. I suggest purchase AC from renown brand like Samsung, Panasonic (I don't promoter this companies) because LLOYD/Havells has pathetic customer service experience.#badservice from Lloyd

Mixed bag experience",4.0,"Boilng of egg is awesome. Previously I was anxious while boiling egg following usual procedure as to whether it will be boiled exactly to the extent that I want. But in this egg boiler it is hassle free. Just follow the minimum instructions and rest will be taken care of by the boiler machine. Egg will be perfectly full or half or low boiled as u want, that too with auto timer.However my experience with preparation of making poach is not upto expectations. I shall have to experiment with it without following instruction booklet that made it almost like full boiled one with different shape of course.Easy to use and clean.

It's fine product.",4.0,"We are using this one for two weeks and what we feel after using this is it's a pretty ok product not too bad or not too good because really hard when you want soft egg because as per the criteria you can get the soft egg if you put less water but most of the time we didn't get soft boil egg and if you make the hole in your egg then after boiling you see that some of the part is came out and make your machine dirty. So you can buy it but still you have to make so much effort to make soft egg, medium boil and specially porched egg.

3rd purchase in 25 years",5.0,"This is my 3rd purchase since past 23 years for the same make on 2.2 ltrs.Earlier this product manufacturer was National and last 2 purchases manufacturer is Panasonic. My years of issue free usage says everything about this product.It works efficiently for cooking and automatically switches to warm mode.This product not only cooks the rice evenly but never burns it. The sensors have always worked.Once left the rice cooker on for 12 hours and it automatically switched from cooking to warm mode and still rice did not get hard or dry. This says it all.Last machine is scraped after 12 years as I accidentally used CIF cleaner on the metal and plastic parts. And it corroded the plastic in 1 year. My bad luck otherwise my last machine would have last another 2-3 years.I recommend this product to only those who want quality and hassle free product. Ofcourse check the price comparison with different capacity models.Hope my review helps all readers.

There is a metal wire loop fixed just above the side grab handle - the user manual does not have any clue what it's for. Trying to figure.Just keep in mind two things:1.

Efficient and User-Friendly Vacuum Robot, but Not Worth the Price",4.0,"I purchased the device a month ago, and I must say, it has significantly lightened the cleaning workload for my mother in our 1300 sq ft house. This device is incredibly easy to program and use, making it a convenient addition to our household chores. While it has its limitations, overall, it has proven to be a good buy.One of the standout features of this vacuum robot is its user-friendly interface. Programming it is a breeze, allowing us to effortlessly schedule cleaning sessions according to our needs. Its performance has been commendable, efficiently navigating through our home and leaving no corner untouched. The device lives up to its promises and delivers the expected results. At times, it's confused. But again, it's easy to bring it back to its senses.Maintaining the vacuum robot is also hassle-free, as it is easy to clean. This saves us valuable time and ensures that the device remains in optimal working condition. The customer service during the installation process was decent, providing a satisfactory and convenient experience.However, the mopping feature of the robot falls short of expectations. While it can effectively be used once a week, the frequent refilling required to cover our entire house is inconvenient. It demands at least three refills, which can become tiresome over time. Although it serves its purpose, there is room for improvement in this aspect.Additionally, the battery life of the vacuum robot could have been better. While it is sufficient to clean the house twice on a single charge, an extended battery life would have been appreciated. However, it is worth noting that the suction power of the device is exceptional. I have never seen the floors so clean in ages, and it truly justifies the purchase.On the downside, despite offering four different modes, including a ""silent"" option, I was disappointed to find that it did not live up to its name. The noise level remained nearly identical to the ""Standard"" mode, which was unexpected. It would have been ideal if the ""silent"" mode truly provided a quieter operation, allowing the device to clean the house without disturbing the peace. Unfortunately, it fell short in this aspect.Nevertheless, considering the impressive suction power and the overall effectiveness in cleaning, I still believe that this vacuum robot is worth the purchase. It efficiently reduces the workload, leaves the floors spotless, and offers convenient programming and scheduling options. Despite the minor flaws, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, making it a worthy investment for a cleaner home.Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that my mother, who is over 60 years old, has been able to handle and use the vacuum robot without any issues. Its user-friendly design caters to different age groups and abilities, making it accessible for individuals like her.In conclusion, this vacuum robot has been a valuable addition to our household, significantly reducing the cleaning workload and providing convenience. However, the limitations of the mopping feature and the questionable value for money prevent me from giving it a full endorsement.

VFM",5.0,"All is Well with this Vacuum, except some software glitches that cause the Robot to Disconnect from the Wifi even being within 5m of the range of the router. Causing it to spin on the spot till reconnection is successful. Battery lasts for almost 2 full house vacuum and mops (house is approximately 30m²). Cleaning the tanks (Dry and Mop) is a regular chore, the central brush has to be cleaned at least once in 3days (I don't have pets, so it isn't so frequent cleaning for me).If only Xiaomi could work on the Network Connection Glitch and source a stability update. Otherwise it is bang for buck for the Premium Features at Affordable Price. Others in its competitors do the same work but ask a premium of 8-10K more than this one's price tag

Frustrating experience",1.0,"On the day of purchase, it had problem during the initial setup where an error message was playing telling me to ""place the mop on the floor to start"". However, after a full charge, the error disappeared and i didnt face this problem again.This was working perfectly for the past 1 month without any issues but recently, the same issue showed up again. This time, error did not disappear ever after a full reset or a full charge.I submitted a complaint with Mi customer service and while i did get a call from them a week later, they were not at all helpful.The person who called mentioned that he does service only for water purifier and that he will forward the complaint to the service center.  I didnt hear back from him or the service center after 2 weeks and when i called him back, he told he will share the contact details but i havent received any yet. Hence, i have logged one more complaint on the website now.This is beyond frustrating and i regret not having replaced this when the issue first appeared on the day of purchase as it would have been much easier.Moreover, the standby battery life is also bad. After a day of inactivity, it would drain all the battery and hence i have to keep it charged the whole time.My advice would be that if you find any issues that has the potential to cause a big problem in the future, its better to replace it before Amazon's replacement window closes. Amazon replacement is far better than running behind the miserable customer service that mi offers.Update: After 3 months of constant follow up calls, e-mails and escalations, i finally received a new replacement unit today. Finally a relief. But seriously, don't buy it. The service is still the worse and the only way to get a solution is relentless badgering untill they do the needful.Also, one thing that i noted is that this is not a Xiaomi made product. It is actually manufactured by Viomi which is imported by Xiaomi.(it was mentioned in the box which i noticed only now)Update 2: The replacement unit is now dead. It worked for less than a week. This time, the issue is that i cannot power on, power off, or even factory reset the product. Again i have contacted customer service and who knows how long will it take this time.Again I'm repeating. Never buy this product. Its a waste of your time and money.I'm planning to file a complaint to consumer court to get the amount refunded. There is no other way to escape from this hell.Update 3: I again received a new replacement unit. This time, it was fairly fast as they were able to see my previous complaints because of which they directly escalated it to the back end team. The new unit is working as of now. Hopefully this has a long life. One thing that I learnt is that when the service request is delayed, try as much as possible to get the query to the back end team. Once the ticket is assigned to them, the resolution will be much faster.

Prestige PIC 20 1600 Watt Induction Cooktop with Push button (Black),"5.0 out of 5 stars
Comprehensive Review of the Prestige PIC 20 1600 Watts Induction Cooktop",5.0,"The Prestige PIC 20 1600 Watts Induction Cooktop promises a blend of efficiency, convenience, and safety with features tailored for the modern Indian kitchen. This review delves into its key attributes, performance, and overall value to help you decide if it’s the right addition to your cooking arsenal.**Design and Build Quality**The Prestige PIC 20 sports a sleek black finish that complements contemporary kitchen aesthetics. Its compact and lightweight design makes it easy to store and move around. The build quality is robust, featuring a high-quality plastic body that feels durable and long-lasting. The control panel is user-friendly, with touch buttons that are responsive and intuitive to use.**Performance and Efficiency**With a power output of 1600 watts, the PIC 20 ensures rapid heating and efficient cooking. The induction technology ensures that energy is directly transferred to the cooking vessel, reducing cooking time and energy consumption. This model is particularly suitable for boiling, frying, and simmering, catering well to a variety of cooking styles.**Indian Menu Options**A standout feature is the Indian Menu Option, designed to simplify the preparation of popular Indian dishes. Pre-set cooking modes for items like dosa, curry, and chapati take the guesswork out of temperature and time settings, allowing for consistent results every time. This feature is particularly beneficial for those who enjoy traditional Indian cuisine but want the convenience of automated settings.**Automatic Power and Temperature Adjustment**The automatic power and temperature adjustment feature ensures that the cooktop operates efficiently without overheating or underheating. This smart functionality adjusts the power and temperature levels based on the dish being prepared, enhancing cooking precision and preventing food from burning. It also contributes to energy savings by optimizing power usage.**Automatic Voltage Control**Voltage fluctuations are a common issue in many regions, and the Prestige PIC 20 addresses this with its automatic voltage control feature. This function protects the appliance from damage due to sudden voltage spikes or drops, ensuring longevity and stable performance. It provides peace of mind, knowing that the cooktop is safeguarded against electrical inconsistencies.**Safety Features**Safety is a critical aspect of any kitchen appliance, and the Prestige PIC 20 excels in this regard. The cooktop includes features such as an anti-magnetic wall, which ensures that the heat is confined to the cooking vessel, reducing the risk of accidental burns. Additionally, the appliance automatically switches off if no pan is detected, and there’s a child lock function to prevent unintended usage.**Ease of Cleaning**The cooktop’s flat surface makes it easy to clean. Spills and splatters can be wiped away quickly, and the absence of crevices prevents food particles from getting trapped. This not only keeps the appliance looking new but also maintains hygiene.**Warranty and Customer Support**Prestige offers a 1-year warranty on the PIC 20, covering manufacturing defects and providing repair or replacement if needed. The company’s customer service is generally responsive and helpful, adding an extra layer of reassurance for buyers.**Pros and Cons***Pros:*- Efficient and rapid cooking with 1600 watts of power- Pre-set Indian menu options for convenience- Automatic power and temperature adjustments for precise cooking- Voltage control for protection against fluctuations- Robust safety features, including child lock and pan detection- Easy to clean and maintain- 1-year warranty with good customer support*Cons:*- Limited to induction-compatible cookware- The touch panel might be less responsive with wet or oily fingers- No timer function for delayed cooking**Conclusion**The Prestige PIC 20 1600 Watts Induction Cooktop is a versatile and reliable appliance for any kitchen. Its powerful performance, user-friendly features, and safety mechanisms make it a standout choice, particularly for those who frequently prepare Indian dishes. While it has minor limitations, such as the need for compatible cookware and a sometimes finicky touch panel, its overall benefits far outweigh these drawbacks. For its price range, the Prestige PIC 20 offers excellent value and is a worthy investment for efficient and enjoyable cooking.

The curd just doesn't set even if kept for 24 hrsI don't know if it's a defective piece . Finally I tried an experiment to test it. I heated up the milk and added the culture to it. I then divided it into two bowls. One bowl I wrapped in a thick cloth and kept it in a warm corner and the other I kept in the curd maker. After 4 hrs the first one kept in the cloth had set beautifully whereas the one in the curd maker showed no signs of setting. Even after leaving it overnight it had not set. So for me it has been a complete waste of money.

 It's pretty good and very less.... noisy and 🤩Samsung  once again proved their honest towards their customers.My Points are related to WA**444 model and some points are common.1. For those who receive faulty products - Now it is open delivery from Amazon by which you are free to check for any dents, check the machine if it was used, check for scratches if any etc. Amazon delivery person for sure will wait for 2-3 minutes of this check and please share the OTP only after this. Feel free to do a thorough check before sharing OTP.2. For those who feel that agitator is not rotating freely or machine not washing properly. - Only very few people explain clearly during demo and in most of the cases, they are in a hurry to finish the installation and move on. Coming to the point – We are supposed to put dresses one by one to the drum and in an evenly manner. Many will dump directly from bucket or laundry basket in which dresses are tied together. Should not be overloaded and stop loading clothes at 75 % capacity. You will see that agitator is rotating as expected for a top load. I am not claiming this to be extremely powerful or super speed. If you load clothes to 90 % without distributing / separating the tied clothes, the agitator won’t rotate and clothes wont be cleaned properly.3. For those who feel that water consumption is high - Yes. I agree to the same and this is due to the automatic settings. For most cases, the demo person will suggest using the default cycle settings only and not the manual options. You may select the water level manually. For example – After auto run and diagnostic check , the machine would have proposed a water level of 3 and if you feel that clothes are less, you can manually change to 2. In some days, you will get used to levels and adjusting manually is not a tedious task.4. Rinsing cycles – Again, the demo person will share that the normal wash cycle can be selected if you are putting a mix of daily usage clothes. Remember that the default program for normal wash cycle is 1 wash / 1 rinse / 1 spin. One rinse may not be sufficient in most of the cases as detergent/ liquid may not go completely. I saw some reviews where people are dissatisfied due to rinse cycles. Please note that we can increase the rinse cycle manually for a normal wash cycle also. Just press the start button-> again press the function button and you can press to change rinse cycle from 1—5. Always use 2 rinse cycles or 3 (if sufficient water available and allergic to soap residues). For some other models, we can directly adjust the rinse cycles. The default cycles vary as per programmed wash cycle. Example - For Jeans, the rinse cycle is 2 by default.5. Usage of the correct detergent / liquid at the right quantity - This is something which many do not follow, and lot of brands are available in the market. Excess usage of detergents in the machine will cause troubles in the long run. The impact would be very high if non-matic powders are used.6. Prefer simple programmed machines - I preferred this model because of the simplicity in programs- More the programs and more the features, more the chances of getting problem with the boards. Electric items last longer, but not the electronic. I.e., the motor and other electrical parts lasts longer and the company itself knows that. This is the reason why warranty is provided for the motor for long time and only 2 or 3 years for the other parts including electronic boards. But electronics are not like that. Classic examples are our phones. The more the features you go with the machines like Wi-Fi, more program options with various settings, there are higher chance of board problems. I bought this machine as my board of the previous machine became faulty after 5 years and after warranty.

Usha IR 3815 1500W Shock Proof Immersion Rod (Blue),"5.0 out of 5 stars
Excellent both performance and look wise, read below for usage tips",5.0,"Perhaps this is one of the most beautiful immersion rods available currently on Amazon.But it doesn't only look good, it delivers excellent performance, easily boiling a standard bucket of water in around 15 minutes.I did note many negative reviews with pictures showing a broken product. I think a possible reason for this is because people aren't following the instructions properly. Here are a few tips from my side which might prevent such incidents -1. Use a wooden/metal rod to hang the immersion rod while using it. Don't place it directly in contact with the bucket. In most cases, your bucket will burn and might also damage the product.2. There is a minimum & maximum level marked on the immersion rod. Make sure that the water level is within these marks. Going beyond the maximum level might short circuit your device and going below the minimum level might lead to disintegration as shown in many reviews.3. This is just an extra tip. If you want your water to boil even faster, simply switch off power supply and swirl the water periodically. Once I got fully hot water within 10 minutes doing this.4. After usage, use a dry cloth to softly dry the device.5. Don't let the metal part strike anything, as once the inner layer is exposed, it will start to corrode.It's only been a few times that I've used this product as of now and only a long term usage will enable me to write a better review but I think it's going to deliver good performance for a long time.Thanks.

Few days later I had to find their customer support phone number and dialled them. Got to know they have no support via website and finally they lodged a complaint through phone. The executive told me to make a video of the fault and submit it to them via whatsapp.I did the same and 20 days later a new head unit with a brand new motor was delivered to my home.

If you can afford it, I'd recommend getting it!",5.0,"As a vegetarian I wanted to supplement my diet with extra, natural nutrients without having to bulk up the amount of food I eat. I initially resorted to blending to retain the natural fibres and keep it whole, but it was still a lot. So juicing it is, fresh everyday, with all sorts of fruits and vegetables that are safe to eat raw.This was to be my first juicer (and the second in my household) so it required quite a bit of reading and understanding to decide what's best for my needs. Let's see if it helps.SLOW/MASTICATING/COLD-PRESS JUICER (SJ) vs. FAST/CENTRIFUGAL JUICER (FJ)• PRICE: FJs are generally cheaper and more affordable. But I am as serious about juicing everyday as I am about cooking, so while this was an important consideration, it wasn't going to be a deciding factor—as long as it was affordable. I was going for Rs. 10k or thereabouts, but had to bite the bullet in the end as you can see.• SPEED: FJs operate fast to be able to spin the juice out through a filter with centrifugal force, so the RPM matters. On the other hand, SJs run slowly because they need to grind and squeeze the produce to get the juice through a filter without causing too much friction (and heat as a result). This reflects in how fast the jucing is done, where FJs win but SJs available today aren't much further off.• POWER: A powerful motor allows the juicer to handle tough fruits and vegetables effortlessly. It is my understanding that the top of the line FJs pack a strong 800-watt motor whereas prosumer SJs come with a 200+ W motor.• EFFICIENCY & YIELD: SJs offer excellent juice quality, are more efficient thanks to the process of juicing involved, and therefore are good for juicing a wider range of produce. A more efficient breakdown of the plant fibres means not only more juice (i.e. less juice or wetness in the ejected pulp) but more nutrients from crushed plant cells and membranes. This also means the juice is more rich and colourful from SJs. You need to understand that the yield isn't too bad with FJs (there's perhaps a 5-10% difference), except with leafy greens (e.g. spinach, amaranth, wheatgrass, etc.) and soft fruits (e.g. berries), as far as I know—where SJs seem to outperform them. In general, SJs excel across the widest range of ingredients in comparison.• HEAT: This is generally brought up as a disadvantage of FJs. I don't believe it as I've found the claims to be generally unrealistic. For normal day-to-day use, say for 1 or 2 people, the amount of heat generated is going to be inconsequential to the nutritiousness of the juice, including enzyme activity and oxidation, for immediate intake.• CONTINUOUS OPERATION. While heat should not an issue for most, what you must consider is the limit on continuous running time. Some brands recommend not juicing for more than 45 seconds per session and that information is hidden somewhere in their juicer's manual, specs or product video. Depending on your needs this may be a severe limitation imposed by some FJs. Good SJs, on the other hand, can run safely for 15+ minutes.• NOISE: Even the good FJs are damn noisy and loud, close to a blender, I'd say. The only prominent noise SJs produce is that of the crushing sound of the produce you are juicing. SJs are so quiet, who knew?! Color me surprised!• FOAM/FROTH: Foam is what collects at the top of the juice, whereas froth is tight air bubbles mixed together with the juice. The thing is, foam is easier to separate from the juice; just use your palm or a big spoon to hold it when pouring juice into a glass and voila, just juice. Not only is gulping frothy juice is hard, it also discolours more quickly due to oxidation resulting in a much shorter shelf life of the juice. Depending upon the fruit or vegetable being juiced, FJs produce frothy juice with some foam to go. SJ juice is barely frothy, if ever (e.g. with leafy greens), in my experience. SJs are brilliant in this regard. This distinction is something you don't see mentioned clearly enough and one that people commonly misunderstand or misstate.• SIZE & WEIGHT: FJs are comparatively fairly compact and light. For e.g. Philips' fast juicer HR1855/70 (Viva Collection) weighs 4.2 kg vs. their 5.8 kg masticating juicer HR1887/81 (Viva Collection). On the other hand, the Kuvings B1700 weighs 10.3 kg, but that's okay, it's still easy to move around. This goes in the ""doesn't matter"" territory for me.GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS• Download and read the product manuals; view the official product how-to videos before making a decision. Some of the important aspects and information, that you'd otherwise miss, are always in there somewhere.• It's beyond doubt that both FJs and SJs give a highly nutritious juice. Claims made online or by the companies often wildly exaggerate the difference in quality between them. It's some pseudo-science, backed by limited research that's not necessarily peer-reviewed. So beware!• CLEANING: Newer models in both lines of juicers are easy to clean and roughly take just about the same amount of time.• SERVICING: Be sure to confirm with the companies that the area you are in is serviceable or has a service centre for the product you are purchasing. For e.g. I am having a terrible time getting my faulty Microsoft Surface Pro 7 replaced, having to travel ~ 600 km to get the replacement myself.• If you want any juicer to last, cut/slice whatever you are feeding into it, irrespective of what the company claims. When you take care of things, they last, unless the product is crap in the first place. This is coming from experience.THE REVIEWAll the points stated above about slow juicers (SJs) are actually based on my experience using the Kuvings B1700, along side the reading, of course.I've been using it for over a fortnight now, and it's been beyond satisfactory so far. I am very happy with my purchase and the only thing that's left to see is how long this thing lasts! (The 10-year warranty on the gear & motor and 1 year warranty on the product definitely help.)• You'll receive a welcome message on WhatsApp sometime after delivery. It provides information regarding the extended warranty offer (+2 years upon registering your purchase on their website) and links to some useful video guides to get you started.• Simple and fast assembly and disassembly in under a minute once you get used to it. I recommend learning it carefully.• All the parts that touch the food are made with stainless steel (e.g. juice strainer/filter) and BPA-Free food grade plastic.• The juice generated by some kinds of produce (especially leafy greens and cabbage, for example) is astounding. Definitely beat my expectations. Who knew!?• Just to see how things work out and to learn more about it, I juiced all sorts of fruits and vegetables available around my place, including: leafy greens (spinach, amaranth, wheatgrass, mint, coriander), cabbage, snake gourd, bottle gourd, ridge gourd, beetroots, carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers, sweet melons, papayas, pomegranates, sweet limes, apples and pineapples. The B1700 handled them very well without breaking a sweat.• The feeding tube is large enough (76 mm) to drop whole medium-sized fruits & vegetables (that aren't too hard) like apples; peeled oranges, sweet limes, and pomegranates; kiwi; tomatoes; etc., although I prefer not to.• The ejected pulp wasn't as dry as dry grass (my expectations be damned!), but it didn't have any level of juiciness to it, which was a great relief.• It retains some fibre, producing juice that is just about the right consistency for me—not watery, not thick in any way.• Allows for continuous non-stop run time of 30 minutes. It takes less than 10 minutes for the two of us.• The 240 W motor runs quietly, and is powerful enough to juice tough produce comfortably. For comparison, most other slow juicers pack a 150-watt motor, including Philips's flagship Viva Collection Masticating juicer HR1887/81.• Can do more than just juicing if you purchase their accessories (not included), including nut milks, smoothies and sorbets.• Cleaning is simple and easy, and takes anywhere between 5±2 minutes depending upon how thorough you want to be. Most of your time is spent cleaning the strainer/filter, as with any juicer. No surprises there, but the rotating brush and the cleaning brush in the kit make it fairly easy if you follow the instructions provided in the user manual and the introductory videos. All it takes is some getting used to.• After-sales support is also available on WhatsApp and they respond fairly quickly.Personally I don't see a reason why anyone would want to get a fast juicer anymore, if not for their price.Good luck finding your ideal juicer!

Portable and affordable",5.0,"The electric kettle is a must-have appliance in any kitchen, and it's essential for anyone who loves to have a quick and efficient way of boiling water. After researching and testing several electric kettles, here's my review of the product.Firstly, the design of the electric kettle is sleek and modern, making it an excellent addition to any kitchen. The compact size means it doesn't take up too much counter space and is easy to store away when not in use. The kettle is made of high-quality materials, such as stainless steel or BPA-free plastic, ensuring that the appliance is durable and long-lasting.One of the most significant advantages of using an electric kettle is the speed at which it heats water. This electric kettle is no exception, heating water in a matter of minutes. The automatic shut-off feature is also a great safety feature, as it ensures the kettle turns off once the water has boiled.

Changing the batteries is a nightmare as the cell cap does not come out fully and after inserting one battery cell it starts to partially close and leaves no space to insert the second battery.

They lagged for 10 days to visit the technician. Technician visited and said gas leakage, and said we need approval from coustomer care to refill the gas. Is it charagable for gas filling?? If so y they mention some warranty on the product. Plz guys don't buy this product anymore. Especially don't buy from online sources. Visit the nearby stores to buy the product, so that we can easily raise the complaint or any issues and they can be solved immediately. I request all not to buy this ac anymore.

Excellent product, worst installation team",4.0,"Product pros:1. 5 star with ISEER 5.2 rating2. Affordable price for 5.2 rating3. Dust filter4. Free installation5. All other features in the descriptionAC Cons:1. Stand for outdoor unit is not included2. Only 2-way swing3. Remote doesn't have LED backlight. Its a pain to use the remote in the dark.4. Noise level is 45dB. Could be quieter. Not a big deal thoughAdditional Costs:Installation details given in https://www.amazon.in/b/ref=amb_link_2?ie=UTF8&node=14621404031 are perhaps outdated because the installation team charged rupees 1000/meter for extra copper wire whereas in the given link, it is mentioned as 750/meter. The installation team blamed inflation when asked.Stand for the outdoor unit is charged 750. The extra copper pipe, cord wire, drain pipe, clamps, etc costed 5000 as extra 3meters was needed in our home. The AC comes wit 3meter worth of these materials by the way. Thankfully, installation was free of cost.Installation team review:1. Unsatisfactory installation2. Unprofessional behavior3. Too long installation timeIncident: Drain pipe started leaking in couple of minutes after installation. We called them back immediately and they just used tape to stop the leakage at 2 places. Later that night, it started leaking again but from other places. But when called again, they refused to fix it and suggested us to use the tape.The next day, we raised a complaint to Samsung and asked them to send a senior person to visit. This new guy(professional) concluded that the drain pipes were damaged and those types of drain pipe shouldn't have been used in the first place(as its 6m between indoor and outdoor unit). So, he replaced the whole drain pipe with PVC pipe free of charge and fixed very quickly. Its been almost 2 weeks and there's no issue so far.

Extremely Disappointed with Samsung AC - Unresolved Issues, Poor Customer Support",1.0,"I am writing this review with a heavy heart to express my extreme disappointment with the Samsung AC that I purchased from Amazon.com on 1 month ago and the ac stop working within a month. The experience I have had with this product and the subsequent customer support has been nothing short of a nightmare.First and foremost, the AC unit I received turned out to be defective. Despite my high expectations from the renowned Samsung brand, the product failed to deliver even basic functionality. The frustration began when I contacted Samsung's customer support, hoping for a swift resolution to the problem. Little did I know that this was just the beginning of a long and arduous journey.Over the course of several weeks, I have made countless calls and followed up persistently with Samsung's customer support team. While they appeared initially responsive, the actions taken by the support team have been ineffective and disappointing. The technicians sent to my residence were unable to resolve the issue during their visits, leaving me with an unusable AC unit.What adds to the frustration is the lack of accountability and ownership displayed by Samsung. It is disheartening to invest hard-earned money in a product that fails to function properly and then have to endure a prolonged and ineffective customer support process. The continuous promises of resolution, followed by further delays and ineffective attempts at repair, have left me feeling betrayed as a customer.I strongly urge potential buyers to reconsider purchasing any Samsung AC units based on my experience. The lack of quality control, coupled with poor customer support, indicates a disregard for customer satisfaction and a lack of commitment to delivering reliable products.As a consumer, I believe in providing fair feedback to help others make informed decisions. In this case, I must warn potential buyers against the Samsung AC based on my firsthand experience. I sincerely hope that Samsung takes this feedback seriously and takes immediate action to rectify the issue for the sake of future customers.In conclusion, my experience with the Samsung AC has been nothing short of a disappointment. The defective unit, coupled with the ineffective customer support, has left me frustrated and dissatisfied. I expected much better from a brand as reputable as Samsung, and I sincerely hope they address these concerns promptly and provide the necessary solutions to affected customers.

Efficient and compact",4.0,"The mincer arrived on time, in good condition, in its own box inside Amazon packaging. The product is well finished and light enough to use with ease and minces efficiently. I hv used it for all kinds of meat, even fish with bones. The blade is easy to fix and remove which makes cleaning hassle free. The motor fixes and comes off smoothly and the large 2 speed bottons on top are a huge plus. There is a un attached non skid washer/gasket like extra piece provided that is meant to be placed under the bowl when in use, IMO a built-on anti skid feature would have added value. The bowl is smaller than i expected and barely holds 2 liters of fluid without the blade installed, so does not actually mince 2 liters/2000gms at one time. Overall a good machine, efficent, compact, light weight and easy to use, though size/capacity mentioned is deceptive and i would have liked the steel bowl  to have higher gauge.Update 3rd March 24:I used the machine to mince raw fish and all the blades broke.

Powerful grinder that saves time and effort in the kitchen",5.0,"I recently purchased the SKYTONE 700W stainless steel electric meat grinder and have been extremely impressed with its performance. As someone who enjoys making their own sausage, burgers, and other ground meats from scratch, this grinder has been an invaluable addition to my kitchen.The 700W motor provides plenty of power to effortlessly grind through meat, vegetables, fruits, nuts, etc. I've ground pork, beef, chicken, and turkey with ease, even when working with partially frozen meat. The large hopper allows me to process decent quantities of meat in one batch.The stainless steel construction is durable and easy to clean. All the parts that come in contact with food are detachable and dishwasher-safe. The 2 liter collection bowl is a good size and convenient for collecting the ground meat or transferring it for further processing.It's a very stable unit with suction cup feet to prevent slipping. The buttons are intuitive and it's easy to disassemble and reassemble between uses. It even came with 3 different grinding plates and blades to adjust coarseness.For the price, I think this grinder offers tremendous value. It saves me so much time compared to grinding meat by hand or with a smaller grinder. I'm very satisfied with its performance and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a powerful, versatile countertop meat grinder. It has become an essential tool in my kitchen.

"AGARO Supreme High Pressure Washer, 1800 Watts, 120 Bars, 6.5L/Min Flow Rate, 8 Meters Outlet Hose, Portable, for Car,Bike...","5.0 out of 5 stars
Easy to use & Hassle free…..",5.0,"The build quality of this product is really very good and easy to use, also for the 1st time user. The pressure is real piercing. (Avoid the direct contact with the pressurised water flow).The major drawback of this product is the water canon gun. This gun came with the non swivel connector that makes the washing process a bit complex and this leads to tangled hose. And also the washing can is of no use.Overall, the product is really good & worth the price.

It's a great value for money product",5.0,"It's easy to use. The connecters are well made. The pressure washing capabilities of the product is way more than you think, It is so much that it actually take cement of pavement! Be a little carefull and use pressure regulator to turn down the pressure. I saw a lot of reviews talking about noise but it is not that much, But it is a motor so there will be some noise. It is not too much noisy. I initially bought it to clean my car, I also boat a foam cannon to go with and since the design is general it supports all types of foam cannons. Two things I found bad in the product is, One, The foam bottle is absolute trash, but I don't really think that's a big issue. Two, is the length of the pipes and cord is not enough, If it would have been a little longer the product would have no issues at all.

You even can't hear yourself. (It feels less noisy on the first day but gets more and more noisy gradually after use)Remote only works at a very short distance. ( 4 or 5 ft)  Also, it's sencer is placed at the top on the tower facing upwards, so it doesn't work effectively.Difficult to move it because no wheels and no handles are provided.No function is given to limit it's horizontal movement. E.g 0° to 90°.  You may stop it but can't precisely control it.Conclusion - Don't buy.No effective speed control.Cheap plastic. It gets yellow after use.Costly.

 I recently purchased the Bladeless Tower fan and have been using it for several days now. I live in a hot and humid climate, so finding a reliable and efficient fan was a must. After doing some research, I decided to invest in this best product.Experience:I have been extremely impressed with the Symphony Bladeless Tower Fan. The bladeless design is not only aesthetically pleasing, but it also makes the fan much quieter than traditional blade fans. The 3 speed settings allow me to customize the airflow to my preference, and the oscillation feature helps to cool down my entire room. The remote control is a great convenience, as I can easily adjust the settings without having to get up from my bed or couch.

As per the authorized service person, This unit should always be powered ON. If not it fails!!",4.0,"Dear Amazon support team,Greetings !!I wish to share my not so positive experience with the purchase of one product on Amazon. I would like to know if anything could be done from your side, that would help me.I purchased a GODREJ 30 litre CUBE refrigerator on 21.06.2021 (Invoice copy enclosed for your ref.,)It was intended for keeping the medicines of my aged in-laws. It worked perfectly all right for almost a year. As we had to go out of home for a month, the unit was switched off. After returning home after a month’s time, the unit was not working properly and it did not get cool at all.The service engineer from M/s Godrej analysed and informed us that the cooling engine has failed and it has to be replaced at a cost of Rs.4000/- He also stated that the unit should never be turned OFF and always should be in ON condition. Because we had kept it in OFF condition for a month, the failure has occurred. This condition was never mentioned in any of the literature provided with the unit.Amazon site states that this unit is user installable and engineer will not come for installation. But the service engineer from M/s GODREJ told that if the unit was purchased from a GODREJ dealer, service engineer would have come and explained this cause to the user. Because of our purchase of this unit through AMAZON, we had no option of knowing this technical issue.As a Prime member and having purchased two laptops costing a lakh rupees each and a host of other costly electronic gadgets on amazon, I feel cheated by this heavy financial loss.I request you to kindly give priority and analyze my case thoroughly  and provide me a favourable solution, which will augment my higher regards I have for AMAZON.

Authorized technicians seem to know that Gorej Qube cooling engine is bad",5.0,"Dear Amazon Support team,Much like Mr. K Vijaykumar's review from 17th Sept 2022, my cooling unit too got busted a right after 1 year warranty period got over. And the authorized service people seem to know exactly why. The Godrej Qube cooling unit is faulty.My 1 year warranty got over on 18th April 2023, 10 days ago.2 months ago, on 26th February, the cooling stopped. I raised service request. The technician cleverly came, cleaned the dust from cooling unit to resume the cooling temporarily, and left without diagnosing anything.A week after 18th April, I had to raise request again for same issue. This time the technicians came directly with 4000/- Rs cooling unit, ready to install it if I pay up again. No diagnosis done as yet. I was offered a 6 month warranty on that unit too, more if I did AMC with them. This was unsealed unit.I reported this to customer care. Ms. Akanksha from customer care from Godrej spoke to me on Thursday 27th April and assured to help me, saying you won't have to pay up anymore. On Friday 28th April, she refused we ever had a conversation. Thankfully I have all the records to prove this. On email, they don't reply  [ Godrej request number : 322288 ]It's a highly disturbing trend where Amazon customers are being betrayed by such practices on part of Godrej. Please help us out.

Excellent innovative product",5.0,"A very innovative and useful product.  It has been the talk of people visiting and they were very keen in buying for themselves.  Remember that this is NOT a fridge and will NOT cool or refrigerate items. Food especially requires temparature to be maintained at 4 degrees C or below.  This unit will maintain temp at 8 - 10 degrees Centigrade. It is ideal for keeping soft drink cans, Beer cans, curd, fruit juice, eggs etc cool. Do NOT store any cooked / food items as it will get spoiled .  Can store milk packets and boiled milk overnight, but not long term.  Butter/cheese cannot be stored as it required to be stored at 4* C or lower.  Size is very compact and it looks very attractive.  The innovative technology of cooling ensures cooling without a refrigeration compressor, so not water dripping or need to defrost.  It make a bit of humming noise which is normal.  Ideal for Kitchen, Bedroom, Bar etc.

Worst product, please refund or replace it",1.0,"I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the Crompton IHL 251 1500-Watt Immersion Water Heater with Copper Heating Element and IP 68 Protection (Blue) | B07K2HVKLL (IHL 251 NW) that I purchased from Amazon on January 24th, 2024. Within a mere two to three uses, the product became defective on February 7th, 2024. This appliance was primarily utilized by my senior citizen parents for their daily needs.Given the significant investment made in purchasing this product, I am deeply disappointed by its sudden malfunction. What exacerbates the situation further is the refusal of Crompton's customer service team to take any action despite the product being well within its warranty period.I believe it is entirely unreasonable for a product to fail so soon after purchase, especially considering its intended use and the reputation of the Crompton brand. The refusal of your customer service team to address this matter only adds to the frustration and inconvenience experienced by my family.I kindly request immediate action to rectify this situation. I expect either a replacement unit or a full refund for the defective product as per your warranty policy. Additionally, I urge you to review your customer service protocols to ensure that such incidents are handled with the necessary diligence and empathy.Please provide clear instructions on how we can proceed to resolve this matter swiftly. I trust that you will prioritize customer satisfaction and promptly address this issue to restore my faith in Crompton's products and services.Thank you for your attention to this matter. I eagerly await your response and resolution.

"Inalsa Spruce-1200W Vacuum Cleaner for Home with Blower Function and Reusable dust Bag (Red/Black), Standard","5.0 out of 5 stars
great value for money product",5.0,"I ordered this product i.e. Inalsa Spruce Vacuum Cleaner on 24th October under Great Indian Festival Sale and got the delivery on 26th October. Thanks to Amazon Delivery Facility. 5/5 to Amazon for this.Now come to the product review. I am reviewing this product after 2 day use.Pros--First of all vacuum cleaner is all about suction so let me tell you guys this comes with a great suction power of 18kPa with 1200W motor and it is very nice in practice, I cleaned my floor, carpet, shelves, sofa, curtains and this did the great job. I also took the spider web at corners of the ceiling in its suction.-2 lt. washable cloth dust bag is also a more than enough if you are using it at home for personal use.-it comes with 4 kind of attachments - Crevice Nozzle cum Upholstery Brush, Sofa Brush, Multi Brush for Carpet/Floor, Blower Plate comes along with flexible hose pipe with curved hand grip and 2 extension pipes-2 year warranty-Temperature overheat protector-dust bag full indicator, it also shows the red signal if the air passage become blocked by bulky particle.-cord retractor is also a good feature help in auto winding of power cord.cons.--pipe can reach at its maximum of 8ft. it should be of 10ft.(my opinion)-as mentioned on Box it comes with powerful blower but I can genuinely say, the blower function is under power because of the air leakage at blower plate. I would like to tell Inalsa R&D department please work on the tight packing of blower plate so that we can get powerful blower same as suction.-plastic quality of attachments should be improved.durability is 4/5value for money 5/5Go for it, if you are searching for a vacuum cleaner, then this is the best value for money product among all the brands if your price range is between (Rupees 2500-3500) because none of the other brands coming with blower facility. So we can ignore this. Just go for it guys.

"Inalsa Spruce-1200W Vacuum Cleaner for Home with Blower Function and Reusable dust Bag (Red/Black), Standard","4.0 out of 5 stars
Sturdy Powerful & Economical",4.0,"Disclaimer - Am neither an expert on vacuum cleaners, nor I have any association with the vacuum cleaners industry, nor I have any association or paid by Inalsa to write this reviewBefore making a purchase, I reviewed many vacuum cleaners on the market - both big brands such as Eureka Forbes, Prestige, Amazon Basics, Phillips, Kent, Black & Decker and small brands such as Inalsa, American Micronic, Yozo, Agaro, Balzano, etc. We were looking for a reliable and economical vacuum cleaner. Didn't want to make heavy purchase with Dyson, Bosch, etc since the requirement was for a 2BHK apartment and not for very heavy duty cleaningFinally settled on Inalsa because of its pedigree in the local domestic appliances business. Not only have they been around for many years but they also have a big presence in other appliances businesses - so they have some reputation to keep to ensure their other revenue streams don't get impacted due to manufacturing of low qualityvacuum cleaners.  They seem to have a better reason to provide reliable appliances because they are a medium sized player and would want to provide an alternative to bigger brandsThe big brands are just lets say - Big Brands. The failure rate, customer service, negative feedback was similar to the local brands. And they were atleast 30-40% more expensive than the local brands. The local brands customer service, reliability was not so great either. Infact, I could not spot any clear winner who was miles ahead. Every company had all kinds of issues - motor over heating, loss of suction power after few uses, customer service numbers not reachable, low quality plastic body, dust bags ripping off, wire length being too short, etc, etc.So i thought, if everyone seems to have similar issues - just varied by certain percentage points, why not go for something which is an average vacuum cleaner and lower price point with a local brand?  Atleast the spare parts may be easily available in the local market, and repair shops would know how to repair these local brands, as opposed to big brands where repair costs would be too high and spare parts costs are also usually very expensive.These days the bigger brands have the gumption to even charge visit charges to the tune of 250-500 bucks for just a visit. I find that really ridiculous.Inalsa even though not a clear winner from the rest of the lot, made it to my final short list. My thinking was - if this one also goes bad and leads to similar issues like other ones, at the most we would have to write-off 3200 bucks, as opposed to 4200-5000 bucks with the bigger brands. When I bought Inalsa, I purchased it with the mindset that if it goes bad - then I have to write it off as ""money sunk"".But am glad to report that its been a week that we have been using this vacuum cleaner and it has done a good job so far.- Suction is good (will have to wait for a few months to check the performance though)- Body is solid- Wire length is very decent and of good quality- Have not used the blower yet- The accessories are strong and made from good quality plastic- we initially wanted to purchase a vacuum cleaner which did not have a dust bag but just a chamber for collecting dust. Vacuum cleaners with the chamber option were more expensive and having the same problems like most other vacuum cleaners. So even though, Inalsa has a dust bag, we decided to go for it for other reasons mentioned above.- Most of the vacuum cleaners who provide a dust bag option, their dust bags rip off quite easily and those are either not available for purchase separately, and if they are then its very expensive to buy these dust bags. - Dust bag is very good quality with Inalsa and its washable. And Inalsa provides an additional dust bag as part of its accessories.- Number of accessories/attachments are limited as compared to other brands - but that's really not an issue. Its enough for a home use. Other brands try to hoodwink you by offering more attachments and accessories, and in that process sell a low grade vacuum cleaner at a higher price point. This is not the case with Inalsa. Strong vacuum cleaner with limited attachments. It totally works for us.- Its important to remember that every vacuum cleaner gets heated. That's the nature of these machines. So if you continuously run any vacuum cleaner for 10-15 mins, you are going to get a burning smell and the engine may even cut off. So its always a good practice to run the vacuum cleaner for 3-4 mins and turn it off for the motor to cool off. This way you can keep running the cleaner for longer duration without impacting the motor. Please remember its a machine which gets heated when overused. So use it in a manner which allows it to also cool off.- Retracting function of the wire is smooth. There have been some complaints by other users that the function gets spoilt over period of time, so will have to wait and watch on this one.- Packaging of the vacuum cleaner was very thorough. It came in two boxes for better protection during shipment.- Have not used the dust bag indicator as yet - but we clean the dust bag after every use. Its just a good practice to follow from a hygiene point of view. Just like how you throw out your garbage bags everyday - you clean the dust bag after every use. We have not the need to wash the dustbag yet.- you don't need the instruction card to use the vacuum cleaner. Even a kid can operate it.- 2 years warranty offered. But frankly speaking we are not banking on that. Just like any other big or small brands, warranties are just a carrot. If a machine has to go kaput, it will. And if the manufacturer wants to pin the blame on you, it will. And if they want to charge you for spare parts, they will. We have never factored in ""warranty"" on our purchase decisions. If something goes bad, we take it a local repair shop or call someone home (not from the company, most of them are very notorious for over-charging). I don't have any experience with Inalsa yet, so this comment is not in any ways a reflection of their service levels. Only time will tell.As I mentioned earlier, Its been only a week using this vacuum cleaner. So far so good. No complaints.I will again post a review after few months of usage. Hopefully my vacuum cleaner would have survived by then.I had a really tough time while evaluating for a vacuum cleaner on Amazon, Flipkart and few other sites, so I hope this review helps in some measure other people to save their time and make their decision on purchasing a vacuum cleaner

Polycab Elanza 5 Blade 400mm Mini Pedestal Fan with 2 Year Warranty (Black),"4.0 out of 5 stars
Light weight budget mini pedestal fan",4.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I have been using this mini pedestal fan for more than 4 months, at an average of 12 hours per day throughout the week. So far, I didn’t face any issues. I got it for INR1,900, against the box MRP of INR5,900. It comes with a 2-year warranty and I also purchased one year extended warranty on Amazon.Package:The package comes with plastic blade, 2 iron rods, a heavy iron base with screw, metal frond and back grills to protect the blade, bubble wrapped fan motor, warranty card and user manual.Specifications and Usage:As the name suggests it’s a min pedestal fan with transparent plastic 5 blades. We won’t be able to see the blades when fan is in full speed. As you can check in my video. The company claims to offer 400mm sweep with mini blades, which seems to be true. The installation is easy to follow from the user manual. We can use the two rods to use it as pedestal fan with height standing up to 5 feet, or by use only one rod we can use it as a table fan. The fan is very light and makes very less noise even in full speed compared to other conventional table fans. It’s very stable as you can see in the video, it doesn’t wobble even on full swing.The fan motor is covered with plastic and offers 3 speed setting with oscillation. Over all the fan looks sleek and slim. It also has thermal fuse protection from overheating, however I didn’t face any issue even after using it for more than 12 hours for all days of the week.Cons:1. We have only two heights to use, either as pedestal or table fan. Multiple height adjustments are not feasible as the rods doesn’t have the feature2. Though it’s not a major drawback, observed that compared to my other two pedestal fans (Bajaj and Impex) this one catches more dust on the blads. Requires at least bi-monthly cleaning after 12 hour of use

It is an average quality water filter, no service for this model",3.0,"We bought this model as a replacement for our ever best HUL Pure-It filter after much searching. But from 6months of experience I can tell that  Pure-It was way better product than this Aquasure model as it has two system to filter water, this has only cartridge. But there are not many options for gravity based filters out there. This has good capacity water container, almost 20L but the filtering system of cartridge is not good quality, it is just ok, may be better than drinking water directly from tap. The filter is not as sturdy as Pure-It and it needs some time to assemble, like 30min-1hr as the manual is not detailed about this.One more thing, the aquaguard service for this model is almost non-existent, you call up several times they take the call but never turn up. One should avoid buying this if it needs any frequent servicing.

Problem in assembling/ tap not working properly",4.0,"There is no proper guide or video available regarding assembling. It took a lot of time assembling all the parts as I never knew where to fit which part. I even searched vairous videos om youtube which where of no help. Later after doing much of tither wither I managed to assemble it. And alas just to find that the water was not coming through the tap. The tap was also not functioning properly as I have always to use a particular position inorder for water to come out. Man that's damn frustrating. The previous non electric purifier by HUL PUREIT was much better but alas they don't manufacture it anymore.

A bachelor's guidebook to this machine's usage:",5.0,"Review update on March 2019 (Bought on Aug 2016) - 2.5 years reviewFirstly, bumping up my stars from 4 to 5. My machine still works like a charm. No power degradation over the years. No rust and the plastic body is still as good as new. Handle it with care and it will last long. Reliable one, very happy with this washing machine.Update after 10 months of use:I am still amazed by this little wonder. Nearing about 100 washes with this machine and it is still as good as new. No degrade observed in motor power. Pretty sturdy, I constantly move it from hall to bathroom for wash, and back to the hall, yet no creaky sounds or loose nuts/ parts (Ofcourse, I treat it with care). This one is a must buy._________________________________________________________First things first:1. It is a washer and it does its job well2. Build quality is good and sturdy3. Looks good and light weight, can be moved around easily and occupies very less space4. Noise while washing is normal and gentle, not loud at all5. Consumes very little electricity6. Has a rust-free plastic body so you need not worry if you are using hard water for washing7. Consumes appropriate water, and water wastage is minimal8. Has two washing modes: Normal and Heavy9. Has a sound alert which is loud enough to alert the end of washing and auto offNow, how can you make the best of your washing experience:1. Fill the water through the water inlet hose till the required capacity (based on how much clothes you have)2. Use a good liquid detergent and use your hand to mix it up with water (I suggest to use a detergent which makes less foam)3. I usually wash my clothes by the weekend, till then I have a good amount of clothes piled up so I separate them into 2: Soft clothes (tshirt, shirts, etc) and hard clothes (like denim, jeans, bedsheet, etc). Being a bachelor I repeat the jean usage for about 2 to 3 times before I wash it (well, that is what jeans are for).4. First round for the soft clothes, soak the soft clothes in the detergent mixed water for about 5 to 10 mins.5. On the washing machine in normal mode for 5 to 10 minutes (based on the load)6. Now have a check on shirts for the collar dirt (if any and scrub), flip the clothes inside out (I have experienced this to work like charm, yes, it requires a bit of manual intervention but this small effort can get your clothes much cleaner, especially for bachelor's who wear it multiple times before a wash)7. On the washing machine in normal mode for another 5 to 10 minutes (based on the load)8. Drain the water and refill the machine with fresh water (this for the rinse and left over soap on the clothes)9. On the washing machine in normal mode for 5 minutes, drain the water, take the clothes out and dry them.10. Repeat step 4 to 9 in hard mode washing for hard clothesIf you are washing clothes which are wore once/ have minimum dirt, manual intervention is not required. Over the past month I have reduced the repetition of wearing a cloth so it makes my washing job easier. Hope this helps people out there.I haven't faced any issues with this machine yet have been using it for a month, it would be hard to comment on the reliability until used for over a year. I feel it is a bang for the buck. Anybody considering to buy a washing machine with a tight budget can opt for this one.

A Compact Powerpact Washer",5.0,"This is a must have for those, who wants to bypass the Manual Labor for washing Clothes without shedding much money.I bought this for Rs. 5,100/- (unfortunately I didn't get any discount or offer at that time).First of all, this is a Washer Only. This doesn't have any Drum & Spinner. So, after the wash your clothes will be wet. That is the purpose of this washer actually; it washes and the activity ends there.Build Quality:What you see is what you get. The fiber-plastic used is really of good quality. Doesn't feel cheap. It has a Good Powerful Motor. The propulsion is really heavy. You can see it during wash. It has two pipes, inlet and outlet -- both are of average-good quality.Pros:The price -- only around 5kThe Build Quality @5k is really impressiveThe Motor is really strong and powerfulEasy to Operate -- only two Knobs available -- One for Soft\Heavy Type selection & Drain, the other one is for time selectionLoud Buzzer sound after the Timer is complete\reaches to ZeroYou can put water into it using regular bucket or Mug or pipe connected to TapDrainage is pretty faster and drains the water fullyReally light weight, even women can move it easilyCons:At this Price Range, I didn't find any cons so far.It does what it is meant for.If your family have 4-5 members and if you have an habit of washing daily, then its perfect fit your you.Process:Put clothes in itPut detergent in itFill it with water (using bucket or Tap\Pipe) -- water level should be as per clothesTurn the Knob for Timer to minutes you want -- (generally I put it for 6 mins for regular wash)then Drain the water, and fill it with water againTurn the timer again and drain it again -- (generally I put it for 3 minutes on second iteration)That's it!!

I had to open the fridge to check if it's on.2. Makes ice in 45 minutes. Very useful.3. Ample space for all the items. The space for bottles in the door is very wide.4. It has base drawer. Vegetables that don't need freezing (potato, onion, garlic, ginger) can be kept here.5. The inside veggie box is also very spacious.Cons1. Only one ice tray is provided. Generally it should come with two ice trays.2. No door ajar alarm.3. The lower portion of the back is open. The compressor is visible. That should be covered if possible.Overall, value for money for a small family. Easily go for it.

The technicians are helpful as well.However, the plastic container that came with this claim microwave proof but they are not.The plastic items are idli making set and another plastic bowl with cover and laddle.I cooked rice and boiled potato in that bowl and the inner plastic started became bad. White spots were visible as if the outer layers came off. With each cooking it got worse.So, plastic containers are not reliable to cook food directly.If your see white spots on the plastic container stop using that to keep food or cook.Rest of the accessories like steel racks, rottiserie rods, the micro proof dish, and papad rack were well high quality.I'm satisfied with this purchase.

After extended use exceeding 20 minutes, the handle tends to emit an unpleasant odor. This odor can be a bit bothersome, but it doesn't compromise the pan's cooking performance. It's a reliable kitchen tool for preparing delectable paniyarams and other snacks, provided you can overlook the handle's occasional odor issue.

Mist/smoke is not consistent throughout the operation",3.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The humidifier is working good, at beginning the mist was coming out in good quantity. Now after 7days the mist/smoke is not coming out or in very less quantity sometimes. I researched online and concluded that I need to clean it. I wiped the inside and open the parts and reassembled the device but their was minor improvements. I think it also depends on the already present air molecules and humidity in the room. The problem I was facing was consistent from like 4th or 5th day. I used for 4-5 hours throughout the day.I have used Lavender and Eucalyptus essential oils, both worked good.One thing you should know its a cool humidifier meaning it uses fan. Other humidifier utilizes heating element or UV radiations. This one is good because of the fan.

Ideal for a small room or bathroom, not for living room",4.0,"I have been using this for the past 2 weeks and writing this review after extensive use.The below feedback is based on the following usage pattern:1. Used for 2 weeks2. Each day runs for 10-12 hours continuously3. Restarted the device when power cut happens4. Used in living room [20ft  x 16ft ], bedroom [little smaller than living room] and bathroom [6 ft x 8 ft]. All measurements are approx.5. My primary usage is for aroma/ diffuser only1. The built is good, does not look cheap2. The outer cover does not have a lock mechanism, so be careful while moving it. Always hold it from the base.3. The power cable is long enough to suit any socket/ table, don't expect a 5-6ft cable4. Not suitable for the living room. You have to close all windows, doors, and balcony access and use this for 10 min – 15 min to be effective. I keep the balcony door open so it was useless5. Can be used in a bedroom with windows closed, 5 mins and you get the desired aroma. Open the window and it takes more time.6. I am in Bangalore so not using AC, hence have to open windows. I switch it on 15 mins before sleeping while doors/ windows are closed7. Excellent for bathroom8. I ordered “Pure Source” aroma oils [pack of 9]. Need to add 10 – 15 drops if using in the living room, 7 – 8 drops when using in the bedroom, and 4 – 6 drops when using in the bathroom. If you are using it in a room which has AC, reduce the quantity to half9. Fill the water in the container, a little less than brim [description says it has a watermark but it was not there] and add aroma oil. One full, it can be used for almost 7 – 8 hours, depending on where you are using.10. I use it continuously for 10 – 12 hours, a red light comes on when the water level is low and the device turns off automatically.11. Register on the website immediately for a warranty.12. It can be used as a night lamp too, but I have not used that so far

It gives accurate weight for now. It all depends on how you maintain. Keep in mind don't put weight more than 5-6 kg for longer life, as it's a delicate product.

"Godrej 1.5 Ton 3 Star 5-In-1 Convertible, Inverter Split AC (100% Copper,I-Sense, 2023 Model, AC 1.5T EI 18TINV3R32-GWA/AC...","1.0 out of 5 stars
Not worth the money",1.0,"Writing the review after a year’s use.Pros1. Easy to use,2. Haven’t had any issues since installation3. Easy maintenanceCons1. Does not chill the room as any other standard AC would.2. Consumes the same amount of electricity despite a higher energy saving rating.3. Costs the same amount of money.Overall the AC cooling is not up to the mark. When temperature is only 40-42 it feels like a cooler rather than AC and at no point of using the AC you can switch it off and sit for a while because it does not chill the place like other ACs. I have replaced the AC now with other brand and that made me realise how low performing Godrej AC was. Recommend to buy some other brand

 1. it's affordable compared to other brands , cooling is excellent  3.  I bought Godrej 1.5 Ton AC.  4. remote is very good , good response.  5. No free service after installation  6. installation charge was cheap compared to other brands like bluestar. Only concern is bad noise when you try to operate it at C3 to C5. At C5 noise is very irritating. except noise at C5 everything is good. advisable to run at C1 or C2 and temp above 25 degreenoise level is comfortable . having copper condenser. highly recommend 👌 for people having low budget. godrej provides 1/5/10 yrs warranty on comprehensive/PCB/Compressor.

So Far so good",5.0,"This 2023 model of 1.5T 3 star is quite good. I have got it @Rs 31,000 which is good at this price point. The installation charge was ₹1415 but i also paid ₹999 for the ODU stand, ₹30 per feet for drain pipe mine was 7 ft and another ₹400 for wrapping tape so TOTAL INSTALLATION COST ₹3024. This cost is very high so buyers pls keep this amount accounted for. My installation location is Howrah West Bengal .Now the Air Con, its design is very nice IDU is quite big and give a nice feeling in a big room. In 20 min run at 25 degree its cooling is very good for a room size of 140sqcm. It has several other features too like 5 mode to control the compressor power, sleep, clock, timer, auto clean like feature plus few others such types.ODU is quite good in built quality and is also decent in size and weight.

Godrej service is very bad and poor. Technicians are very rude.",1.0,"The AC we bought stopped cooling after 2 days of Installation and shows E6 error, godrej customer service is very poor...they just send the technician and didn't try to solve the problem, they just told your PCB got defected so you need to buy new one for 14000 rs + service charges, there is no warrenty on PCB board from Godrej. Technicians don't have manners, so poor service.We just bought it 2 days before , why should we spend lot of money on it .Luckily all this happened in 7 days and thanks to Amazon they accepted return request.Otherwise godrej and technicians would have charged us more than 14000 on newly bought AC and they don't even suggest us return.

While the likelihood of getting burns in other heavy irons are very high, in this its nil. This is also heavier than Bajaj. The sole plate is very good and hearts up very fast. Plus a two year warranty from an old established brand. That should suffice to meet the expectations of most customers

 It's pretty good and very less.... noisy and 🤩Samsung  once again proved their honest towards their customers.My Points are related to WA**444 model and some points are common.1. For those who receive faulty products - Now it is open delivery from Amazon by which you are free to check for any dents, check the machine if it was used, check for scratches if any etc. Amazon delivery person for sure will wait for 2-3 minutes of this check and please share the OTP only after this. Feel free to do a thorough check before sharing OTP.2. For those who feel that agitator is not rotating freely or machine not washing properly. - Only very few people explain clearly during demo and in most of the cases, they are in a hurry to finish the installation and move on. Coming to the point – We are supposed to put dresses one by one to the drum and in an evenly manner. Many will dump directly from bucket or laundry basket in which dresses are tied together. Should not be overloaded and stop loading clothes at 75 % capacity. You will see that agitator is rotating as expected for a top load. I am not claiming this to be extremely powerful or super speed. If you load clothes to 90 % without distributing / separating the tied clothes, the agitator won’t rotate and clothes wont be cleaned properly.3. For those who feel that water consumption is high - Yes. I agree to the same and this is due to the automatic settings. For most cases, the demo person will suggest using the default cycle settings only and not the manual options. You may select the water level manually. For example – After auto run and diagnostic check , the machine would have proposed a water level of 3 and if you feel that clothes are less, you can manually change to 2. In some days, you will get used to levels and adjusting manually is not a tedious task.4. Rinsing cycles – Again, the demo person will share that the normal wash cycle can be selected if you are putting a mix of daily usage clothes. Remember that the default program for normal wash cycle is 1 wash / 1 rinse / 1 spin. One rinse may not be sufficient in most of the cases as detergent/ liquid may not go completely. I saw some reviews where people are dissatisfied due to rinse cycles. Please note that we can increase the rinse cycle manually for a normal wash cycle also. Just press the start button-> again press the function button and you can press to change rinse cycle from 1—5. Always use 2 rinse cycles or 3 (if sufficient water available and allergic to soap residues). For some other models, we can directly adjust the rinse cycles. The default cycles vary as per programmed wash cycle. Example - For Jeans, the rinse cycle is 2 by default.5. Usage of the correct detergent / liquid at the right quantity - This is something which many do not follow, and lot of brands are available in the market. Excess usage of detergents in the machine will cause troubles in the long run. The impact would be very high if non-matic powders are used.6. Prefer simple programmed machines - I preferred this model because of the simplicity in programs- More the programs and more the features, more the chances of getting problem with the boards. Electric items last longer, but not the electronic. I.e., the motor and other electrical parts lasts longer and the company itself knows that. This is the reason why warranty is provided for the motor for long time and only 2 or 3 years for the other parts including electronic boards. But electronics are not like that. Classic examples are our phones. The more the features you go with the machines like Wi-Fi, more program options with various settings, there are higher chance of board problems. I bought this machine as my board of the previous machine became faulty after 5 years and after warranty.

Excellent Value for Budget-Conscious Buyers",5.0,"The HiFresh air cooler offers excellent value for its price. Here’s a detailed look at its features and performance:Cooling PerformanceThe HiFresh air cooler provides noticeable relief from the heat, making it a suitable option for smaller to medium-sized rooms. While it may not be as powerful as some high-end models, it does a commendable job of lowering the temperature and creating a more comfortable environment. It's particularly effective in rooms where the heat isn't extreme, offering a refreshing breeze to keep you cool.AffordabilityOne of the standout features of the HiFresh air cooler is its affordability. It's priced competitively, making it an attractive option for those on a tight budget. Given its performance, it offers excellent value for the money, providing a cost-effective solution to stay cool without breaking the bank.Noise LevelWhile the noise level might be a bit high for some, it is manageable and tends to become background noise over time. If you’re using it in a living room or kitchen, the noise is unlikely to be a major issue. However, for very quiet environments like a bedroom or home office, it might be a bit more noticeable. Nonetheless, the cooling benefits outweigh the noise for most users.Build QualityThe build quality of the HiFresh air cooler is acceptable for its price point. While it doesn't have the premium feel of more expensive models, it is sturdy enough for everyday use. With proper care, it should last a reasonable amount of time. The materials used are decent, though not top-tier, and the overall construction feels somewhat flimsy but not overly fragile.Ease of UseThe air cooler is user-friendly, with simple controls that make it easy to operate. It typically features multiple speed settings, allowing you to adjust the airflow to your preference. The inclusion of wheels or handles makes it easy to move from room to room, adding to its convenience.Energy EfficiencyAnother positive aspect is its energy efficiency. The HiFresh air cooler consumes less power compared to traditional air conditioners, making it a more eco-friendly and cost-effective option for those looking to reduce their energy bills.MaintenanceMaintenance is relatively straightforward. Regular cleaning of the water tank and filters will ensure optimal performance. The design allows for easy access to these components, making the cleaning process hassle-free.Design and AestheticsThe design is simple and functional. It may not be the most stylish appliance, but its neutral appearance allows it to blend in with most home decors without standing out.ConclusionOverall, considering its cost-effectiveness and the cooling relief it provides, I would rate the HiFresh air cooler 5 out of 5 stars. It’s a good option for anyone looking for an affordable solution to stay cool. While there are areas where it could improve, such as noise level and build quality, its benefits far outweigh these minor drawbacks. For budget-conscious buyers, the HiFresh air cooler is a solid choice that delivers on its promises.

Product issue",1.0,"The cooler stoped working within a month. The cooler has too many do’s and dont’s..,. The merchant Amazon and the Hifresh brand both are extremely unprofessional … I first raised a concern with the brand Hifresh and they did not even bother to resolve the issue. Post which I went for Amazon help. I made around 40 calls, spoken to 40 different representative after which nothing happened… I have spoken to 2 different Escalation supervisor from Amazon , one of the supervisor gave me an email consent that if the return of the product is failed ( 2 attempts ) I am eligible to get a advance refund, however the second escalation person mentioned I am not eligible to get a refund even after the 2nd attempts get failed.  They all know it’s a cooler return and they sent delivery agents on bike, and both the time the delivery agents came in bike and they refused to take the order.  I am not even received my money neither they have taken the product.  I am stuck. Amazon only giving fake promises and statements……. guys don’t fall for a trap, go for brands like Croma and all they hear u. Amazon is only for fake statements and they never hear customers pain.

Perfect for Personal Cooling Needs!",5.0,"If you're in the market for a personal air cooler or one suited for a small room, the Hifresh Air Cooler might just be the answer to your needs. As someone who was initially eyeing the Symphony Diet 3D 55i+, I stumbled upon the Hifresh Air Cooler during my research, and I'm glad I did.Who is it for? Well, if you're like me, seeking a cooler for personal use or to cool down a small area, this cooler is tailored just for you.Here's what I like about it:1. Compact: The Hifresh Air Cooler's compact design makes it easy to place in any corner of the room without taking up much space, perfect for small areas or personal use.2. Low energy consumption: I appreciate the fact that this cooler doesn't guzzle up energy like some other models on the market. It's efficient, helping me stay cool without worrying about skyrocketing energy bills.3. Less Noise: The last thing you want is a noisy air cooler disrupting your peace and quiet. Thankfully, the Hifresh Air Cooler operates quietly, allowing me to work or relax without any disturbances.4. Low water Consumption: Unlike some other coolers that seem to constantly need refilling, the Hifresh Air Cooler has a low water consumption rate, meaning fewer trips to the sink to top it up.5. Innovative Water Bottles: One feature that particularly impressed me was the inclusion of water bottles that can be frozen and added to the water tank. No more scrambling to find ice cubes – this thoughtful addition ensures consistent cooling without any hassle.Now, onto what I didn't like as much:1. Limited Air Throw: While the Hifresh Air Cooler does a decent job of cooling, its air throw is limited to about 6 to 7 feet. It's important to manage expectations – this cooler won't cool down an entire room, but it does help reduce the temperature in its immediate vicinity.Overall, the Hifresh Air Cooler perfectly fits my needs. It may not cool down an entire room, but for personal use or small spaces, it's a reliable and efficient option. I'm happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone in a similar situation.

Easy, economical and perfect - Review after one month of usage.",5.0,"Requirement was to have hot water in our new rented apartment (family of 3), primarily used for bathing from bucket. Using the heater for a month and found it perfect for our family use. I was confused between instant and storage water heaters. And finally took the plunge seeing the reviews and it turned out to be good. Hot water comes quick, and can easily fill a whole bucket if you keep the tap half/quarter open.As other reviews, the unit gets shipped without the 3 pin connector and the pipes. I got if from the shop outside and installed the unit myself. It is doable but do take caution while fixing the 3 pin connector.Don't fret, go for it!

Convenient and Portable Blender for On-the-Go Nutrition",4.0,"The BlendLife Pro Portable Blender with Sipper is a handy companion for those who prioritize health and convenience, particularly during long trips or travels. While it boasts several notable features, there are some drawbacks to consider before making a purchase.Firstly, the portability of this blender is a standout feature. Its compact design makes it easy to toss into a bag or suitcase, ensuring you can enjoy fresh juices, shakes, or smoothies wherever you go. This aspect alone makes it a valuable asset for frequent travelers or individuals with busy lifestyles.However, the price point of the BlendLife Pro may give some potential buyers pause. While the convenience it offers is undeniable, the cost may be prohibitive for some consumers, especially considering the additional expenses associated with purchasing quality ingredients for blending.Another aspect to consider is the plastic quality of the blender. While functional, it doesn't quite meet the standards of durability that one might expect, particularly given the price. This raises concerns about long-term durability and reliability, especially for those who plan to use the blender frequently.One notable improvement that could enhance the user experience is the addition of a lock mode. As mentioned in other reviews, the absence of a locking mechanism can lead to accidental spills if the blender is inadvertently turned on while in transit. Incorporating a secure locking feature would address this issue and provide users with added peace of mind.In summary, the BlendLife Pro Portable Blender with Sipper offers convenience and versatility for users seeking on-the-go nutrition. While it excels in portability and ease of use, potential buyers should carefully consider the price point and plastic quality before making a decision. Additionally, the absence of a lock mode is a notable drawback that could be addressed in future iterations of the product.

It is an average quality water filter, no service for this model",3.0,"We bought this model as a replacement for our ever best HUL Pure-It filter after much searching. But from 6months of experience I can tell that  Pure-It was way better product than this Aquasure model as it has two system to filter water, this has only cartridge. But there are not many options for gravity based filters out there. This has good capacity water container, almost 20L but the filtering system of cartridge is not good quality, it is just ok, may be better than drinking water directly from tap. The filter is not as sturdy as Pure-It and it needs some time to assemble, like 30min-1hr as the manual is not detailed about this.One more thing, the aquaguard service for this model is almost non-existent, you call up several times they take the call but never turn up. One should avoid buying this if it needs any frequent servicing.

Later after doing much of tither wither I managed to assemble it. And alas just to find that the water was not coming through the tap. The tap was also not functioning properly as I have always to use a particular position inorder for water to come out. Man that's damn frustrating. The previous non electric purifier by HUL PUREIT was much better but alas they don't manufacture it anymore.

The old product stopped after every 5mins; it's like an auto timmer was set for every mode.It's easy to use if a person like me who has never cooked in his life can use this, then you can also use it. Different modes really make it easy to cook. I think it's best for a bachelor like me.It's straightforward to clean; just take a tissue paper an wipe everything off; it easy as that, no wash is needed.Note you will never be able to cook food as well as you used to cook on regular gas. Induction starts heating the food from the bottom, so you need to stir it regularly; otherwise, your bottom part will get burnt. You must keep an eye on food when cooking in induction.

Good but not better",4.0,"::: Review after ~2 months :::• Air speed is more than adequate.• Remote control for on/off, speed control, sleep mode, oscillation and timer is added bonus. Mostly used for first 2.• Noise is less compare to conventional fans.• Too stylish at the same time minimalistic design.• When you want to keep it near while sitting (like wfh) in chair/sofa, 2-3 speed setting is more than enough with less noise to bear.• Feel of using latest technology is plus. Energy savings are not noticeable (with a atomberg ceiling fan and this pedastal fan) in this 2 months.• Blade is made out of plastic but it is easy to remove and clean.But....• Packaging was too poor, devasted when it arrived. Till it's assembled and working, was stressful.• No height adjustment at all, earlier table fan height adaptor provided but they removed suddenly and totally felt wrong in this purchasing decision.• Tilting down is restricted to little. You can't use  it when you're sitting/sleeping in floor in any sudden situations (remember no table fan adaptor provided).• Very important design flaw, the part where bolt provided to attach rod of motor and rod of base often comes loose and once fell which I fear nowadays whenever we keep it near. Please improve team.Except last 4 points i felt, the product is good. Hope it's useful for your purchasing decision.

Above average. Good buy",4.0,"Amazon buying experience was extremely simple n the best.Coming to the atomberg fan itself, is an above average product, what I love is the minimal look and sleek, black finish is excellent n pleasing.Quality of the components feels just above average. Assembling is easy n straightforward except for 1 step, which involved removal of a plastic stuff (see the pic )from the blade’s centre hole. This step is confusing as it is not mentioned in the setup guide either. I had to YouTube it!! Another horribly substandard part is the locking clip  ( which has screw- see the pic ), it will definitely break if one uses more than just needed pressure, it’s plastic n they really really need to provide something stronger! Reducing a star for these 2 points mentioned here.Functionally it seems good. Up to 3 it is silent, 4-5 n B mode is noisy but has ample throw.

Poor backend infra",3.0,"Fan works fine but the backend support system sucks. I could not register warranty card. The website returned an error. When called the warranty registration number, it did not recognize the key stroke and hung up. This is a bummer :(The fan works well. Liked the remote control and the independently motorised swivel. Fan is silent upto speed 3, but beyond that the wind noise dominates even though the motor is silent. The air throw feels a bit less than my earlier pedestal fan of similar type. The shaft could have had 2 screws instead of one to keep it perfectly vertical - right now once it is tightened fully, the shaft stays a little slanted.

This fan is not only powerful but also remarkably silent, making it a game-changer in my home.The BLDC technology is a true innovation.

With six different speed settings, I have complete control over the airflow to suit my needs, whether it's for a gentle breeze or a powerful cooling effect.The build quality is top-notch, and the sleek design blends seamlessly with my home decor.

Neatly done fan, works well",4.0,"I bought this fan for reducing the power consumtion as running fan whole day consumes quite a lot. On power rating, it consumes less power.Speed 2: 5WattsSpeed 3: 9-11 wattsFull Speed: around 28-30 wattsSo overall happy on that front.Cons: Height adjustable is not possible, and also can not convert to table fan either. So this is a major drawback. Fan can be bent, but it is little delicate.Overall staisfied with fan.

Efficient exhaust with great suction power and close to noiseless operation",4.0,"I had been looking for exhaust for washrooms and these designs with collapsible flaps looked great considering that it prevents insects and mosquitoes entering via washroom. Having good history with this brands product, I went ahead with the exhaust and with a few minor things it turned out a good decision. One year plus and its still running fine.•••••••••••••••••••🎁 INSIDE BOX•••••••••••••••••••1x exhaust unit1x operating manual4x screws4x nylon sleeve2x rachet screws with square nuts (can be used as an alternative fixing arrangement, either on frame (details below) or to hang it from the top side)Cable length: 55 cm➕ PROS1. Its made of plastic, but have a solid built and motor also looks sturdy.2. Capacitor arrangement is hidden inside a pocket on one of the corners3. Length of attached cable is more than sufficient to reach power point even if above the false ceiling4. Suction is good and 200mm model air flow is sufficient for washroom use case (I have installed these in 8'x5', 9'x6' washrooms)5. Flaps are quite useful, as they prevent insects and mosquitoes when exhaust is not in use6. Noise during operation is on the acceptable side and you wont notice it from other rooms if left on. Its kind of noiseless, if if has unobstructed incoming air flow from some areas in the house.7. Two way fixing arrangement - One may fix it via 4 screws by drilling 4 holes on wall/aluminium frame, or use rachet type screws to avoid drilling holes if the existing arrangement supports the way (possible with modern aluminium window frames with square portion with removable glass reserved for exhaust). I fixed it via rachet screws.➖ CONS1. Flap arrangement is a hit miss kind of, and may be your unit is not that smooth. In one of my exhaust, it is like stuck and opens half way only, unless forced. I tried a replacement but it had the same issue.I had to remove the flap assembly and clear the plastic component (small plastic shaft kind of) which attaches to main body to make flap swivels around.2. Oil collector tray is kind of useless, since there is no ditch around circumferential edge which can collect all of the oil and drip in the tray. Its a design flaw, which may render tray useless.⚙️ ASSEMBLY & INSTALLATION- DIY1. It comes in assembled state but in order to fix it you may need to partially disassemble it2. Design is modular, to most of the pieces are press fit3. Rotate spinner to remove it and subsequently remove the blade4. Remove front panel to reveal holes for screws5. Clear the area of glass and frame, if its there in the exhaust's place6. As your case is, either drill holes on wall/frame marking positions (hole dia will vary accordingly- sleeve thickness for wall and screw thickness for frame) and fix via 4 screws with or w/o nylon sleeves (if fixing to wall nylon sleeve required, and if directly to aluminium frame, screw can be directly used)6. Or use rachet screw on two holes at the center of two sides while attach square nut and if required a bigger washer. Tuck nut and washer to the back side of aluminium frame. Holding it via something, tighten the screw via racket head until it fixes.P.S. Don't tighten any of the plastic nut, spinner, or ring screw beyond a point; otherwise, it may slip. You need to find the threshold intuitively.Also, follow dimension guide in the product images carefully to select the model-150mm version if your space is > 170x170mm and < than 240x240mm200mm version if your space is > 170x170mm and < 290x290mm250mm version if your space is > 290x290mm🏆 VERDICTThis exhaust works great if it has unobstructed incoming air. Remember what goes in comes out, so in order to exhaust volume of air, it will need that volume of incoming air, so somewhere across the home some window or duct must be open to provide that volume. Else it will make noise, since it has to work hard to pull in air from edges of doors and windows.

Reliable and Powerful",5.0,"Title: Reliable and Powerful: A Review of the Havells Ventil Air DX 200mm Exhaust FanI recently purchased the Havells Ventil Air DX 200mm Exhaust Fan for my bathroom, and I couldn't be happier with my decision. This exhaust fan is a game-changer, providing strong air suction, a rust-proof body, and dust protection shutters that make it perfect for any environment.First off, let's talk about the air suction power. It's impressive. This fan effectively removes all unwanted odors and moisture from my bathroom in no time. Even when the room is filled with steam after a hot shower, this exhaust fan quickly clears the air, leaving the space feeling fresh and clean.The rust-proof body is another standout feature. Living in a humid environment, I was worried about the longevity of the fan, but the rust-proof construction gives me peace of mind knowing that it will withstand the test of time.I also appreciate the dust protection shutters. These shutters prevent dust and debris from entering the fan when it's not in use, ensuring that it remains clean and efficient at all times.Installation was a breeze, thanks to the clear instructions provided. The fan is also relatively quiet, which is a plus for a bathroom exhaust fan.Overall, I highly recommend the Havells Ventil Air DX 200mm Exhaust Fan to anyone in need of a reliable and powerful ventilation solution for their bathroom, kitchen, or office. With a 2-year warranty and outstanding performance, it's definitely worth the investment.

Beware of Seller: Problematic Product Purchased - A Fan Review",1.0,"I recently had a highly disappointing experience with a seller who sold me a fan that turned out to be a complete nightmare. I feel obligated to share my negative encounter to warn others and prevent them from making the same mistake.First and foremost, the fan I purchased was of subpar quality. It started malfunctioning just a few days after I bought it. The blades emitted a screeching noise that was both annoying and disturbing. Additionally, the fan's speed settings were ineffective, with the lowest setting barely generating any airflow and the highest setting resembling a jet engine rather than a soothing breeze.To make matters worse, the fan also posed safety hazards. The plug did not fit securely into the socket, resulting in frequent disconnections. This loose connection led to sparks and occasional power outages, which put my household at risk of electrical accidents. It is deeply concerning that the seller would offer such a potentially dangerous product to unsuspecting customers.Attempting to address these issues, I contacted the seller's customer service department. However, my attempts at communication were met with utter negligence. Emails went unanswered, and phone calls were either ignored or met with empty promises of resolution. This lack of responsiveness and accountability only exacerbated my frustration and disappointment.In hindsight, it is clear that this seller prioritizes profit over customer satisfaction and safety. They seem to care little about the quality of their products or the well-being of their customers. It is both disheartening and alarming to see such a lack of professionalism and ethics in the business.I strongly advise against purchasing any products from this seller, as their practices and lack of accountability are unacceptable. Save yourself the hassle, frustration, and potential danger by seeking reputable alternatives from sellers who prioritize quality, safety, and customer satisfaction.In conclusion, my experience with this seller and their problematic fan has been nothing short of a nightmare. I hope this review serves as a cautionary tale to others, helping them make informed decisions and avoid the same unfortunate circumstances I encountered.

Amazon should provide complete service or it should stopped selling electronics.

Very good . Can use it on inverter also",5.0,"If you want to chop more veggies at a go, but not want the hassle of washing too many food processor parts , then get this. I use this daily. It's fast to assemble and disassemble and i just show it below the tap and keep it to dry. Very sharp. Totally like this.The garlic peeler attachment is ok ok. But does the job. But it gets crushed a bit in the process. But definitely faster than peeling with hands.Not very noisy.Low power needed, cuts effectively even on inverter.

But it goes to safe mode due to overheating by itself. I have to stop for few hours and once again start with lower volume.

Unbeatable Electric Chopper",5.0,"This Chopper is so amazing that I felt like it's my responsibility to post this review and might be one of my best purchases on amazon till date,I'm writing this review after using this amazing product for a month, this chopper has a stainless steel body which makes it durable while being lightweight, the motor part of the chopper is very durable and effective too, the speed range provided is good to differentiate between finely chopped and just chopped.It's not just that I am super impressed by the product but also it's after sales service, since I've face some initial challenges with the product, let me share my experience.So after you receive this product, you will get emails to register your product and get the warranty started for it and I did the same, after a few days the egg beater was broken, which in general I don't have much use anyway but still I thought of asking the team if I can get a new one or if I can purchase a new one, after raising my concern, within 2 weeks time, I got a new egg beater and I didn't have to return the product. The whole point is, this journey of getting a new egg beater alone was very seamless, which majority of company lacks these days.Note: my usage from this chopper is just to use the blades and not any other additional attachment so I won't be able to give detailed review about them. Also this is a huge size chopper, you can easily chop 300gms - 400gms at once, but it might struggle to chop very lesser volume.Overall if you are looking for a great chopper then this is amazing and will save lot of your time.

"Eagle Digital Pocket Scale with 600 g Capacity, 0.01g Accuracy - Small Weight Machine with Low battery, Overload Indicato...","5.0 out of 5 stars
Harmony of Precision: An Ode to the Eagle Digital Pocket Scale""",5.0,"The Eagle Digital Pocket Scale with its astonishing 600g capacity and 0.01g accuracy is truly a marvel of modern engineering, catering to the needs of precision enthusiasts across various domains. This small weight machine comes equipped with features that are bound to pique the interest of anyone with an affinity for meticulous measurement.Let's begin with the capacity and accuracy of this device. The 600g capacity is a testament to the extensive range of items you can weigh using this scale, from minuscule powders to more substantial objects. However, the real magic lies in its ability to provide accuracy up to 0.01g. For those unfamiliar with the significance of this level of precision, let me elucidate: one gram can be divided into a hundred parts, and each of those divisions is still detectable by this scale. This is essential for industries such as jewelry making, where even the slightest variation in weight can lead to significant differences in value.Now, let's delve into the design and functionality of this scale. The inclusion of a low battery indicator is a thoughtful feature that prevents interruptions during crucial measurements. Picture this: you're in the middle of weighing a delicate piece of gold, and suddenly, the scale shuts down due to a low battery. That's where this indicator comes to the rescue, saving you both time and frustration.But that's not all! The overload indicator is another remarkable addition. The scale is equipped with sensors that detect when the weight placed on it exceeds its capacity, preventing potential damage to both the scale and the items being weighed. This level of protection ensures the longevity of the device and the accuracy of your measurements.Let's shift our focus to the specific applications of this scale. While its utility in the world of jewelry and precious metals is evident, its value in the culinary realm should not be underestimated. Have you ever followed a recipe that required an exact amount of a particular ingredient? The Eagle Digital Pocket Scale eliminates the guesswork, allowing you to achieve culinary perfection. Be it spices, herbs, or even a pinch of saffron, this scale ensures that your recipes turn out consistently delicious.Furthermore, the scale's adaptability is exemplified by its use in laboratory settings. Researchers and scientists often require minute quantities of substances for their experiments. The scale's accuracy enables them to precisely measure these substances, contributing to the integrity and reproducibility of their work.The scale's application in the world of numismatics, the study and collection of coins and currency, is also noteworthy. Numismatists often need to weigh coins to determine their authenticity or grade. The Eagle Digital Pocket Scale's accuracy and portability make it an ideal companion for such endeavors.Now, let's talk about the technology underpinning this device. The scale employs strain gauge load cell technology to convert the force exerted by an object into an electrical signal. This signal is then translated into a digital readout on the display. The incorporation of such technology is a testament to the precision-focused approach that the creators have taken.The display itself deserves attention. Utilizing an LCD screen with backlit illumination, the scale ensures that readings are easily visible, even in dimly lit environments. This is especially crucial when working in jewelry workshops or laboratories, where proper lighting is paramount.The unit conversion feature of the scale is yet another detail that reflects its user-centric design. Users can toggle between different units of measurement, such as grams, ounces, carats, and more. This flexibility caters to various industries and applications, eliminating the need for manual conversions and simplifying the user's experience.Now, let's discuss the construction of the scale. It boasts a compact and sleek design, making it truly pocket-sized. Its portability is a boon for those who need to carry it from place to place, whether it's for business or personal use. The inclusion of a protective cover ensures that the delicate weighing platform remains safe during transit, preventing scratches or damage.Speaking of the weighing platform, its material and design are tailored to maintain accuracy and ease of use. The flat and stable surface ensures that items can be placed on it without any tilting or wobbling, leading to consistent readings. The use of high-quality materials also contributes to the scale's overall durability, making it a long-lasting investment.And let's not forget the power source! The scale is powered by batteries, and its efficient power consumption ensures that the batteries last for an extended period. This is crucial for individuals who rely on the scale for daily measurements, as it reduces the hassle of frequent battery replacements.In conclusion, the Eagle Digital Pocket Scale with its 600g capacity and 0.01g accuracy is a masterpiece of precision engineering. From its adaptability in various industries to its user-centric features such as low battery and overload indicators, this scale leaves no stone unturned in delivering an exceptional weighing experience. Its application in jewelry, culinary arts, laboratory research, numismatics, and beyond highlights its versatility.With strain gauge load cell technology, unit conversion capability, and a backlit LCD display, the scale embodies the synergy of innovation and functionality. Its pocket-sized design, protective cover, and efficient power consumption further solidify its position as a must-have tool for anyone who demands accurate and reliable measurements.In a world where precision matters more than ever, the Eagle Digital Pocket Scale stands as a beacon of accuracy, portability, and technological excellence. Whether you're a jeweler crafting intricate ornaments, a chef perfecting your culinary creations, a scientist conducting groundbreaking research, or a numismatist examining historical artifacts, this scale is your steadfast companion in the pursuit of precision.

Solid Performance with Minor Flaws",4.0,"I've been using this product daily for the past two weeks, and overall, I'm quite satisfied with its performance. Here's a breakdown of the pros and cons based on my experience:Pros:1. Nice build quality: The product feels sturdy and well-made, giving me confidence in its durability and longevity.2. Motor placed on suspension: The motor's suspension design effectively reduces vibration, ensuring a smoother and quieter operation during use.3. Trustable brand: As a customer of this brand before, I've had positive experiences with their products, and this one lives up to the reputation in terms of performance and reliability.Cons:1. Delivery concerns: Unfortunately, the delivery people didn't handle the package properly, leading to concerns about potential faults in the machine. Fortunately, mine seems to be working fine, but this issue needs to be addressed to maintain the product's integrity.2. Heavy machine: The product's weight, approximately 70KG, makes it challenging to move around or reposition, especially if you have limited physical strength or space in your laundry area.3. Slight noise during operation: At 1400 rpm, the machine emits a motor humming and water sucking sounds, which might be bothersome to some users. However, it's not overly loud and still remains bearable during operation.4. Installation experience: The installation guy seemed more interested in upselling additional products than providing detailed information about the machine. It would have been more helpful if he focused on explaining its features and maintenance.

Matchless Gadget!!!",5.0,"Have been using this for the past few weeks.This is my review on it. With its powerful motor and cyclonic action, it effortlessly pulverizes fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds into nutrient-packed smoothies, juices, and soups in seconds. The sleek design and compact footprint make it a perfect fit for any kitchen, whether you have limited counter space or a spacious layout.What sets the NutriBullet Pro apart is its simplicity and efficiency.

Silky-smooth, delicious drinks packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants to fuel your day. Whether you're aiming to boost your energy, support your immune system, or simply enjoy a refreshing beverage, the NutriBullet Pro delivers consistent results every time.While it excels at making smoothies and shakes, it's also versatile enough to tackle tougher ingredients like ice and fibrous greens with ease. The only downside is its relatively loud operation, but the trade-off for its power and speed is well worth it. Overall, the NutriBullet Pro High-Speed Blender is a worthy investment for anyone looking to prioritize their health without sacrificing convenience.

Premium Product at a Premium Price!",4.0,"I have done some extensive 'background checks' before purchasing this product ""Nutribullet Pro - 900 Watts"" and below are main points which might help you make your purchase decision: • Firstly, the most confusing thing around this product is those two different brandings - ""nutribullet."" and ""NUTRiBULLET"" which can be seen in various customer posted images. Their official twitter handle has confirmed me the branding ""nutribullet."" is authentic, though I WON'T say the other one is counterfeit as the same branding products are listed on their parent company's website. Moreover, the user guide and recipe book received in my package is having the later one. • Upon purchasing this product from Amazon, I received a WhatsApp text from their Business Number where they provided some quality information like their contact details, warranty details and website. • As per info. provided by company, they are having 2 service centres in India - Mumbai and New Delhi - but they provide service all over India. Warranty - motor: 24 months, blades: 6 months, other thing: not covered (as on Nov-2020). • As per info. provided by company, ""Matrix Distributor Pvt Ltd"" is their official distributor and I've verified the same on the package I received. • As per confirmation received from their WhatsApp Support Number ""Cloudtail India"" and ""Trade Connect"" are their authorized sellers in India and I verified mine was sold by ""Cloudtail India"". • Now coming to the quality of product, it looks very premium (as the price will tell) after opening the package and I liked it at first sight. The packaging was neat. The motor-unit is very strong and sturdy. All the containers are of premium, toughened plastic. The plug perfectly fits in Indian socket - standard 2-pin plug. Overall it feels premium and high-performance product. The entire set is of 12 units:  ○ 1 main motor-unit  ○ 2 diff. blades (one for making juices, smoothies etc. and other for grinding dry items like Coffee, Masalas)  ○ 1 large jar, 2 small jars (one with and other without handle)  ○ 2 diff. lips rings (one with and other without handle)  ○ 2 lids  ○ 1 Nutrition book and 1 user manual. • I have just used it for 2-3 days mainly for making carrot juice and smoothies. Its 900 Watts power perfectly did the job by NOT leaving any lumps in the carrot juice. Smoothies were even quicker. It is compact (My Aai didn't mind me adding this item on her busy kitchen countertop). Cleaning was easy, but please only rinse and don't use ""scotch brite"" as I did and left some scars on the jars. :-( • I will reserve my final verdict for later as I feel I have not used it extensively to comment on its performance. There are few foreign and couple of Indian YouTubers who have reviewed this product. Please check out the same to know more about its usability. • This is product is indeed ""Made in China"", but so do iPhones. I feel the main argument here is that this is NOT a Chinese company. Nutribullet is owned by a parent company named ""Capital Brands"" which is having HQ in USA. Hence, as per my analysis this does not look like a Chinese company product. I will still suggest to verify all facts. • Lastly, it costed me Rs. 8000/- after standard discount and original price mentioned was Rs. 9000/-. Purchased in Nov 2020. It was quickly delivered the next day of ordering. (I feel this is since it is shipped from Bhiwandi which is nearby my home location in Mumbai).I hope this helps you make your purchase decision though this is not a complete review. I'll put up the same when I feel I have used the product longer enough to do so.

And, after successfully cooking our family favourite dish, we are so happy that even if it doesn't do anything else will not matter for us.Performance of the appliance is upto the mark of brand name for anything it is supposed to do. We've tried our hand on so many non conventional dishes and it hasn't disappointed us in any of our extravagant Adventures.For small things like quickly heating milk for kid, heating Roti or even Bhaat-Daal, it's very convenient by saving lots of time which we generally spend staring into pan/utensil kept on gas stove.Thank you Samsung!!!

The inside is coated with ceramic that's easy to clean and scratch resistant too.👍There are exactly 100 preset menus to choose from. All are mentioned on the door and also in manual.👍When not in use in ECO mode it consumes negligible electricity.👍power cord is 16A heavy-duty but made in China.👎🏿There is no auto clean (deodorizer) function.👎🏿There is no inbuilt battery so the clock function is useless.👎🏿The buttons tactile feel should be improved also dials could be given👎🏿The +30s button doesn't works when setting up initially, it only works when the machine is running.👎🏿The noise level should be drastically improved.External dimensions: (52x45x33)cmInternal usable cavity: (30x30x20)cmRotating glass disc: 30cm diameterPower cord: 16A-250V (120cm length)Weight: 18-20 kg👉🏼Microwave solo: [input 1400w max] [output 100-900w]Microwave can be adjusted as 100w->180w->300w->450w->600w->900w for 10 seconds to 99 minutes.👉🏼Convection solo: [input 2100w max]Convection temperature can be controlled as [40°C - 200°C] with interval of every 10°C for 10 seconds to 60 minutes.👉🏼Grill solo: [input 1500w max]No adjustment for watt or temperature.

But in case it gets affected by rusting (which happened for my case after using 2 years) service center will be denying any replacement or repair saying cavity can't be changed and as per policy will try to give a hugely depreciated amount based on year of purchase (safe to say 70-80% value will be deducted at-least). Buy the equipment for it's good features, but advisable to go for a Steel cavity.

Accurate and easy to use",5.0,"It is a good product for regular kitchen use.• Build: It has a light weighted, plastic body but sturdy enough that it won't break easily if you handle it properly.• Ease of use: It's extremely easy to operate. The fact that it runs on battery as well as on electricity makes it much more convenient than other products that has only one of the two options. An extra thumbs-up for providing a pair of batteries and a cable charger along with the package.• Accuracy: I have been using this product for over four months now, and have weighed a wide variety of cooking ingredients on it. The instrument has a good accuracy for kitchen use. It measures in two units - kilograms and grams. If you need to measure something in milligrams, go for a laboratory grade weighing machine instead.

Crompton Wave Plus 400-mm (16 inch) 60W Oscillating Pedestal Fan (KD White),"5.0 out of 5 stars
All features declared are accurate.",5.0,"The pull push knob was not installed. It has LH threads. Took some time to figure out, align and fix.There was a loose part inside the plastic motor housing. After tilting and jugling , a small screw fell out.Whilst installing the front cover, I noticed 2 screws holding the Crompton plastic disc. The third was missing. Checked and found that it was the screw lodged in the motor. Unsucessful to fit because the hole in plastic portion had increased/ some defect.Do eliminate the stiff  plastic  wrapping... it would not come off easily.Alter the design, such that the three small screws be elimated.I liked the heavy synthetic base, the high quality powder coating.I do not know if there is power saving at lower speeds, if not fit an electronic pcb... operated by the same switching buttons.Noise level is relatively low. You should declare the db values at each speed.I checked a number of Fan specs before I choose this one. It hasa good, more than normal air flow.Its definetely worth the price!

Disappointing Experience: Defective Fan Recieved.",1.0,"I recently purchased a fan online, expecting a cool breeze to alleviate the sweltering summer heat. Unfortunately, my excitement was short-lived as the fan arrived defective and utterly lifeless. From the moment I unboxed it, the fan refused to power on, despite multiple attempts. It's motor seems only vibrating.The frustration of receiving a non-functional appliance led me to initiate a return process. Not only did this entail additional time and effort, but it also meant enduring more discomfort in the oppressive heat.This experience has left me deeply disappointed and disillusioned with the quality control processes of the manufacturer. One would expect that basic functionality, such as powering on, would be ensured before dispatching a product to a customer.In conclusion, receiving a defective fan that failed to function upon arrival has been a frustrating and inconvenient experience.

Very dissatisfied",1.0,"I think it is the worst choice one can make for instant water heater. The service is so worst that I had to call my plumber to install the heater properly. Let me explain my experience chronologically. The product came in proper packaging within the time assured by Amazon on 8th May. Then I received a call from AO Smith for installation. The guy who called me was very helpful over phone and he promised that he will come around 11am on 9th May. He has asked me to install the angular taps prior to his visit. But on next day he didn't turn up at 11am so I called him up. He said he may not come on today as he has a product demonstration to attend in his office. When I said I need it to be installed today only then he said he'll come around 3pm. Again he didn't turn up at 3pm so I called him again and this time he said he is not sure whether he can come or not. Then I asked him to handover the phone to his superior and that person ensured that he'll come by 4:30. Again he failed to come within that time and finally he turned around 5:30pm and after reaching he asked me to buy a 16AMp 3pin socket. When I went out to buy the socket he again called me up and said he need to connecting pipes each measuring 18 inches which he can provide but for that I need to an extra amount of Rs.450/- but I bought those pipes (good quality) from a local hardware store at a total price of Rs.200/-!!!! Then after fixing the pipes and 3pin socket he said the heater is not working and he opened up the outer casing of the heater and while doing that he broke one of the two indicator bulb holders. As you can see in the picture that one indicator is not working. He put the blame on Amazon for mishandling the package and some what managed to install the heater and almost flew off taking the service charge of Rs.250/-. As he left I turned on the heater to check whether the heater is working properly or not and as I turned on the heater one of the connecting through which hot water comes to tap came out of the joined as it was not properly fixed by him. I called him up immediately but he refused to come again and asked me to get it fixed by my plumber and for that I had to call my plumber and got it fixed. So, I am very very dissatisfied with the product and service of AO Smith. Won't recommend anybody to buy this heater and considering the standard of installation service I'll ask not to buy any product of AO Smith.

Extremely poor design. Flawed.",1.0,"Been using the Samsung semi-automatic machine for 11 years without any niggles. Changed to whirlpool for a change. (Samsung is still working fine).The machine itself is okay nothing special. But extremely poor ergonomics.1) The drain pipe is short and i mean like very short its shorter than the length of machine.2) the wheels are good to have, but the machine starts to move itself when washing is in progress. Excessive vibrations3) the water filling hose is very small in length and very flimsy material. Its less than even 1 meter.4) water hose connector is a specific type so only the small flimsy hose provided by Whirlpool can be used. Its a money making thing that brand use. First they make brand specific connectors and then mint money out of spares.5) the water connection is directly above the knobs panel. If even the a drop of water spills it will slide directly into the knobs and damage the machine. Again Whirlpool mints money in spares as it will considered as water damage and wont be covered under warranty.6) the water connection has 2 separate inlets 1 for washing other for spinning. Basically you will have to connect and disconnect everytime you need to send water from washer to spinner or vice versa. Whirlpool could have given a toggle switch as most brands have. This reinforces the fact that whirlpool has knowingly designed a machine so poorly that there is no way that it wont get damaged and whirlpool can mint money out of repairs.Its very evident that Whirlpool has knowingly added these design flawsI am surprised as to how this product has got an above 4 rating.This deserves a rating of no more than 2 at best.Worst ~10K spent.Repent not buying Samsung

Good, but I would have wanted to know...",3.0,"This is the first time I've ever used a semiautomatic washer/dryer instead of an automatic set and it is very easy.I live upstairs and could move the machine up the stairs with ease. There are a couple things I wish I knew beforehand though.1. There is hose that comes with it but it doesn't fit my water spout so I have to fill a bucket of water to dump into the washer.2. The dryer doesn't heat the clothes to dry, it only spins really fast to get excess water out.3. It doesn't rinse the clothes at all. I do a second wash cycle without soap after ringing the clothes out to rinse.4. The dryer is incredibly small compared to the washer. I doubt I could fit a comforter inside it.5. The dryer doesn't necessarily dry the clothes. It gets rid of excess water as stated before so after the drying cycle you still have to hang the damp clothes. During rainy season it'd be more difficult to get dry clothes but in the spring/summer months it's easy.6. Although it comes with a lint trap, it doesn't get any lint off the clothes so I'm going to have to invest in a lint roller. Which isn't a big deal, just a minor inconvenience.Overall it isn't noisy and beats doing laundry by hand. Also I feel the dyer cuts the outside drying time down by over 80%

Good fan for a small room, but go for the 400mm model if space is not a constraint",3.0,"I earlier had a 200mm high-speed fan for the kitchen, but it burst into fire one day. I searched for wall fans considering space constraints and settled for a 300mm model.So far, this fan is serving its purpose and working well (Mostly, I use it at full speed as the air requirement is at around 6ft to 7ft distance). But yes, don't miss out on the details below and the final verdict.•••••••••••••••••••🎁 INSIDE BOX•••••••••••••••••••The fan comes in a disassembled state, but it is pretty easy to assemble, owing to a modular design. You can follow the manual, or I have also included my version of the instructions here.1. Base assembly with motor, plastic nut to secure back side grill, and shaft cap or spinner to lock the blade2. Screw and pvc gitti- 2nos each3. Front and back grill4. Plastic guard ring to fix and lock the grills/guard5. Wall clamp6. Warranty card/ Instruction manual in the same leaflet••••••••••••➕ PROS••••••••••••1. Modular design (I remember the previous generation of wall fans and the level of difficulty in assembling those)2. Sturdy and elegant design with metal guards and plastic body3. Good for air delivery up to 10ft. So small kitchens, washrooms, office cubicles, etc can be easily covered4. Has sufficient tilt for the said purposes (It can easily tilt vertically till 45 degrees from the vertical axis)5. Has a lock nut to secure its position while setting tilt (It has stepped slots for different tilt angles, so slipping possibility is minimal)6. Covers 60 degrees horizontal swing7. Pull down rope-based swing and speed control for easy access••••••••••••➖ CONS••••••••••••1. Airflow could have been better (~50 to 60 CFM- Cubic feet per min). Currently, its ~40 CFM, which is a bit low, as opposed to ~70 CFM for the 400mm model2. Swing rope requires extra effort, and you may confuse it for not working if you don't pull with force3. You end up paying a similar price for this 300mm fan as a 400mm one but ~50% lesser airflowFor the said cons, I will deduct 2 stars. But in any case, it's a 3-star device, as it is well suited for its intended usage in small rooms. There is a lot of room for improvement in price and performance.•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••⚙️ ASSEMBLY AND INSTALLATION•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••1. First check first if you have all the pieces to assemble2. Unscrew the spinner (used to fix the blade)3. Unscrew the plastic nut on the motor front (near the base of the visible shaft)4. Fix the rear guard by aligning the grooves to the motor base and use the plastic nut to secure it in place5. Gently push the blade on the shaft by aligning the pin on the shaft to a similar groove on the back side of the hole on the blade6. Once the blade is fully in, tighten the spinner on visible area of the shaft7. Loosen the plastic guard ring and put the front grill on top of the back grill8. Align both grills and ring, and tighten the screw on the ring9. Select the location and mark the mounting bracket's holes on the wall10. Drill and fix fan on the wallP.S. Don't tighten any of the plastic nut, spinner, or ring screw beyond a point; otherwise, it may slip. You need to find the threshold intuitively.••••••••••••••••🎛️ CONTROLS••••••••••••••••1. Set the inclination after loosening the knob on the right side of the motor, following the direction displayed2. Tighten the knob by rotating it in the direction displayed3. Use the left thread to switch on/off swing4. Use the right thread to switch the fan on/off and control the speed••••••••••••••••🏆 VERDICT••••••••••••••••This fan works ok if the room/cubicle size is small (within 7 ft x 7 ft dimension) and is a recommended buy.But, if space is not a constraint for the size of the fan, then definitely go for the 400mm model, as it offers 75% more airflow for the same price.

Quick hot water anytime",5.0,"I ordered this because I had a lower back injury and I needed a hot water bag several times a day. Keeping the geyser on all day was wasting too much electricity and water. For this purpose, this kettle has been a lifesaver. I can reuse and reheat the water from the bag, and it really takes 3-5 minutes to reheat. Cord length is okay. The auto cuto off works fine. The shape is ergonomic enough to hold the kettle comfortable and aim the stream (hot water bags need precision). I won't use it to heat drinking water. There's salt patches forming on the body and the plate like most water heating equipments. I don't think this would be a good material for maggi or milk.

 Good things are mention in the product description am listing only Cons compared to samsung 7kg top load bubble wash as I am also using Samsung for 1.5 yearsMetal body can catchup corrosion or paint loss over the time and even the small collision creates a dent on the metal body so fiber body would be better optionNo DD (direct drive system) in the Q&A Page it is mentioned that it is direct drive but I got to know that it is not fully direct drive main drive is direct and drum drive is belt so it makes more noise and vibration compared to samsung5% more vibration and 10% more noise than samsung, anything you do but don't keep the machine on any type of stand or base support stand it will vibrate even more plat surface is better optionHard water wash requires magnetic filter which costs 2000rs extra otherwise hard water wash does not function but in samsung they have built in magnetic filter no need to worry about magnetic filter in samsungIn any wash mode you select this machine requires more time than samsungIf you are looking for this product with magnetic filter 2k extra then it is good to go for samsung in the same price range.Delivery was bit complicated Delivery guy was bit worried to deliver to 1st Floor as my address did not mention the floor number so I had to tip him which is my decisionInstallation experience was wonderful for duct came with no damage and all the functions were working as it should be.

First review",5.0,"Hmm,Strudy design, quality accessories,reputated brand.I have seen some car vaccum cleaners especially the low cost one's where dust comes out of machine due to poor locking mechanism, so ofcourse you don't want the dust to be falling back when the sole purpose is to remove it!!!You get what you pay for, I have home vaccum clear from same company with has a good suction and does the job well, I wanted a battery pluggable clearner where I can use it anywhere.Believe me no vaccum cleaner is good enough for heavily soiled cars, so if you are expecting a commercial level cleaning the don't buy any.Car vaccum cleaner is a portable device which gives decent satisfaction but not a perfect, I have seen some people who do not take out mats and just shove the cleaner in it and say it's not good.Mats need to be take out which actually collects big dust and derbies, this poor small machine can't handle a 100% cleaning on that.If the car is heavily soiled the you must get it cleaned at a professional clearner then start using the small one.I found this to be doing the job when compared to my house vaccum clearner.One thing I observed was the wires was getting hot and has a soft component which makes it even thinner when it's hit but I think I can handle the job, accessories quality is good and fir and finishe is good.I did not seen any dust seeping through the compartment and it was well contained in the dust chamber.Suction is decent and you can give almost a clean and tidy look to your car with this machine, again a professional grade cleaners can doa good job which cost nothing less tha 15K.I would say worth a buy it used delligently by not expecting too much.I only hope if the company can provide a bag to carry it for the price or find one in your own which can fit your needs.

Go for it - One of the best Convertible Inverter Aircon - Total VFM",5.0,"After lot of research when we decided to buy an Inverter split A/c, soon enough we found that there are models which are non-convertible and convertible. However, I soon found out that in most retail shops, they don't even stock convertible inverter Aircons but only regular inverter a/c, and a very few that have would quote a price north of 40K. We were not interested in non-convertible ones. So we ordered this Samsung 3 star convertible A/c within our budget, and luckily there was a lightning deal ongoing so we got 1K discount.Installation was a breeze (Chargeable), and the cooling is superb for our 170sqft bedroom. I have tried very extensively all the modes and the single user 40% is best once the room has cooled. There is direct 50% less consumption of power on 40% mode which I could verify using the Xenius meter app.

AC performance is very good but installation....",5.0,"Writing this review after one and half month of continous use.First of all, I was looking for budget AC around 30k so this falls right in place. I exchanged my old AC for 4k and I got for around 28k.Pros:1. To the date the performance is very very good. My room size is 12 by 15 with lot of open cupboards, still the room gets cool in max 15 minutes.2. I saw few comments saying that this don't have 4 way swing but that doesnt matter at all as this AC is doing very good job even without it.3. AC notifies when the filters are to be cleaned, I found that feature useful.Cons:1. A very small but very irritating thing is that the AC remote doesnt not have backlight, so during night times it creates problem as you need to turn in mobile torch or turn on light to change any settings. I hope they work on this and resolve it in future one's.2. Installation charges were 2000 plus including stand and pipe, which I feel are very high.Installation Issues:Also the installation guys didn't install the outdoor unit as per our requirements and they just argued when I asked them, as the installation was in half way through so I couldn't cancel it. I raised this issue when Samsung called for feedback so far they didn't took any action.

Excellent product!",5.0,"After analysing all the negative reviews here, I found that there aren't any issues with the product but with the installation. If you are lucky (and can have some other technician with you at the time of installation), this AC works excellently well.Cooling is powerful and sufficient even at 27 degrees C on dry mode. The daily household electricity consumption after keeping this AC on for 8 hours is around 2 units (Mumbai).The remote malfunctions sometimes (freezes), but can be reset after removing batteries.Have not faced any other issues with this AC after usage of over 1 year.Note: You also get one free service from Whirlpool within 1 year of installation.

Best AC in the Market",5.0,"Product is best in its price range. I got the product at 31000/- which includes 1500 instant discount and additional 1500 as Amazon pay cash back. the product is clearly as mentioned in the site. With regards to power efficiency it seems sensible. My monthly electricity bill was increased by Rs.1000 to 1200 on an average use of 5 hours a day. Some what installation was not satisfied. The guys who had come for installation seems fresher and had less experience. They were handling rough while installing the split AC inside. Though charges for installation was 599. They some how try to pull out addition money. So guys, please buy drain out pipe (5m) and wall mount through Amazon while ordering AC into the cart. You will get both at 150+550. However, I need to shell out 300+ 1200 additional to installation amount. Stabilizer is not mandatory but I have installed to safe guard my AC as a precautionary measure beacuse of high investment.

Reasonably good ac",4.0,"The AC is good but for two things.One, the covering over the gas pipes is very weak and useless. It gets damaged during installation itself. Hence it's not possible to survive over a period of time. Must review and supply flexible rubber pipes.Two, the deputed for installation was very poor and novice. They did not know the basics of alignment. Moreover, they made the holes in the wall of the size more than twice than required. Better trained staff is required to maintain the quality and reputation.

Good fan for a small room, but go for the 400mm model if space is not a constraint",3.0,"I earlier had a 200mm high-speed fan for the kitchen, but it burst into fire one day. I searched for wall fans considering space constraints and settled for a 300mm model.So far, this fan is serving its purpose and working well (Mostly, I use it at full speed as the air requirement is at around 6ft to 7ft distance). But yes, don't miss out on the details below and the final verdict.•••••••••••••••••••🎁 INSIDE BOX•••••••••••••••••••The fan comes in a disassembled state, but it is pretty easy to assemble, owing to a modular design. You can follow the manual, or I have also included my version of the instructions here.1. Base assembly with motor, plastic nut to secure back side grill, and shaft cap or spinner to lock the blade2. Screw and pvc gitti- 2nos each3. Front and back grill4. Plastic guard ring to fix and lock the grills/guard5. Wall clamp6. Warranty card/ Instruction manual in the same leaflet••••••••••••➕ PROS••••••••••••1. Modular design (I remember the previous generation of wall fans and the level of difficulty in assembling those)2. Sturdy and elegant design with metal guards and plastic body3. Good for air delivery up to 10ft. So small kitchens, washrooms, office cubicles, etc can be easily covered4. Has sufficient tilt for the said purposes (It can easily tilt vertically till 45 degrees from the vertical axis)5. Has a lock nut to secure its position while setting tilt (It has stepped slots for different tilt angles, so slipping possibility is minimal)6. Covers 60 degrees horizontal swing7. Pull down rope-based swing and speed control for easy access••••••••••••➖ CONS••••••••••••1. Airflow could have been better (~50 to 60 CFM- Cubic feet per min). Currently, its ~40 CFM, which is a bit low, as opposed to ~70 CFM for the 400mm model2. Swing rope requires extra effort, and you may confuse it for not working if you don't pull with force3. You end up paying a similar price for this 300mm fan as a 400mm one but ~50% lesser airflowFor the said cons, I will deduct 2 stars. But in any case, it's a 3-star device, as it is well suited for its intended usage in small rooms. There is a lot of room for improvement in price and performance.•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••⚙️ ASSEMBLY AND INSTALLATION•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••1. First check first if you have all the pieces to assemble2. Unscrew the spinner (used to fix the blade)3. Unscrew the plastic nut on the motor front (near the base of the visible shaft)4. Fix the rear guard by aligning the grooves to the motor base and use the plastic nut to secure it in place5. Gently push the blade on the shaft by aligning the pin on the shaft to a similar groove on the back side of the hole on the blade6. Once the blade is fully in, tighten the spinner on visible area of the shaft7. Loosen the plastic guard ring and put the front grill on top of the back grill8. Align both grills and ring, and tighten the screw on the ring9. Select the location and mark the mounting bracket's holes on the wall10. Drill and fix fan on the wallP.S. Don't tighten any of the plastic nut, spinner, or ring screw beyond a point; otherwise, it may slip. You need to find the threshold intuitively.••••••••••••••••🎛️ CONTROLS••••••••••••••••1. Set the inclination after loosening the knob on the right side of the motor, following the direction displayed2. Tighten the knob by rotating it in the direction displayed3. Use the left thread to switch on/off swing4. Use the right thread to switch the fan on/off and control the speed••••••••••••••••🏆 VERDICT••••••••••••••••This fan works ok if the room/cubicle size is small (within 7 ft x 7 ft dimension) and is a recommended buy.But, if space is not a constraint for the size of the fan, then definitely go for the 400mm model, as it offers 75% more airflow for the same price.

Quality, size, value for money and support",4.0,"I bought the 6kg Whirlpool top loading, fully automatic washing machine. The machine is less than two weeks old. So, it may be a little premature to write realistic review on its performance. Appearance of the unit is good. I got it just before Diwali. So, I got a good deal. 6kg unit is adequate for a couple or a small family. Performancewise it is a bit noisy. Yesterday morning the machine stopped working. I called support and by noon it was fixed. Great service! While the issue is being fixed, I had a chance to look inside the machine. The quality of inner components appears to be good. The issue was with a multi wire connector assembly. I do not know if it was common problem with other machines. But the technician had a spare. Now, the machine is running with only a few hours of down time. So far so good.

Do not buy",1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I own this fridge for 15 months now. I will only mention the cons.1. Freezer side is ok, but the cooling side.. the cool air outlet is on the top most compartment, and there are 5 compartments below. The cool air doesnt reach lower compartments, so there is uneven cooling. Sometimes it takes an entire day to cool down water bottles in lower compartments.2. The touch control panel sometimes turns up temperature automtically to 6 degrees instead of keeping it where i set it.3.the door magnets are way too strong. Require extra power to open the doors.4. The display is faulty and The compressor is gone and company says not serviceable in my area although compressor has 10 year warranty.This is a 3rd class company, do not buy.

Enjoying my cuppa",4.0,"This is a small milk frother but it does it's job. If you add more milk it tends to spill during the process of frothing. Both hot and cold milk froth well. It doesn't need too much force or pressure to froth, anyone can do it, it's simple and easy. The steel body adds to it's elegance. It looks pretty much like a French press. I am not sure if we can use it as one. I haven't tried it as a French press :-). If it's just you alone who uses it, you can go ahead and use the mug as your coffee mug.

Simple design and functionality, straightforward and easy to use",5.0,"The best thing about this fother is that it's simple and easy to use and maintain, no electricity is needed so no running out of power. Just 10 - 12 pumps and you get your frothed coffee as you desired. It can also double as a coffee mug. Easy to clean and maintain, gets the job quickly done, and no hassle about batteries and all.  One downside is that if you fill it with more than half its volume, you might get some spillage, but no other issues so far, I have been using it for more than 3 months and am extremely satisfied with it. The price point could be lowered but all in all a good product.

I've honestly stopped going to fancy coffee places because of this, so that's a huge thing.The bad:I wish there was an easier way to clean the sieve attached to the pump mechanism. Its doable with pumping soapy foam through the container, but I really wish you could take the sieve apart for cleaning it.

"Blue Star Aristo RO+UV+UF 7-Liter Water Purifier, Black, AR5BLAM01","5.0 out of 5 stars
Very good quality, value for money",5.0,"Purchase decision:This is a new model (RO+UV+UF). When I bought, there were no reviews, so I was a little apprehensive while ordering. I checked the reviews for other BlueStar purifier models and ordered this new model.Delivery & installation:The product was delivered very quickly by next day. There was no information regarding installation on this product description. I checked the other BlueStar purifier products listing, and called BlueStar customer service number 1800-209-1177. They promptly arranged for installation the same day within 4 hours. The technician was very efficient, he installed the product within 1 hour. The package contains a free pre-filter (for sediment/dust). The installation was free of charge from BlueStar. We had to pay for a valve (Rs.235), as it's not provided by the builder in our home. After installation, the technician has to take a picture of the installation, we can edit our communication details, and then we'll get an OTP to confirm if we're satisfied with the installation. We get an email with complete warranty details and service performed.Water quality:We have to discard the first tank full of water after installing/changing the RO membrane (apparently it's the standard procedure for RO). The water tastes good. I didn't feel that the tankful was 7 litres (I have't measured scientifically). The pre-filter needs to be changed frequently if your input water contains sediments. I have measured that my input water has TDS of 540 ppm and output water from BlueStar had TDS of 44 ppm. 20 litre (local vendor) mineral water bottle showed that it had TDS of 87 ppm, as a comparison.Operating costs:Warranty is valid for 1 year. The RO membrane (It's a CSM membrane) lasts for 8000 litres. The technician said the approximate cost of the RO membrane is 1700 Rs. Rated power consumption is 36w (similar to a tubelight).Overall, I'm very happy with the product and great installation service from BlueStar.Edit (Feb 20, 2019):Problems & Service experience:After 2 weeks of usage, we noticed water leakage from the bottom of the unit, when filtration is ongoing (i.e., raw input water is leaking from inside the unit). Once tank is full, there is no leak. I booked a complaint with BlueStar via their mobile app, and they sent a technician the next day. He identified the leak was occurring at ""Low Pressure Switch"". But he convinced me (at the time) that it's a low-pressure booster, and is not needed for my house as the pressure is good enough. He bypassed the low-pressure switch, marked the complaint as resolved and left.The purifier was working, but it does not detect when input water gets cut-off / low-pressure. Later on, I read online blogs and found out that the purpose of low-pressure switch is to cut off the pump in case of low input water pressure, and it will prevent the main pump (expensive part) from running dry. If it's bypassed, I may encounter expensive repairs in the long run. I think in his first visit, the technician was trying to fix the issue without spare parts, and trying to avoid a 2nd visit with proper spare parts.I complained to BlueStar via email to make technician perform the proper fix, even if takes 2 visits, and not take short-cuts like this. They promptly took notice of my complaint. They sent the executive again, with a new ""Low Pressure Switch"", and he replaced it correctly this time.I think BlueStar upper management is quite receptive of customer feedback as they acted on it immediately.

Good products with some unexpected shortcomings.",4.0,"Overall a good RO purifier with bundled quality prefilter.+Design and looks are good. Looks  premium.+Had RO, UV and UF with 7 liters of storage and doesn't cost a bomb.+Decently fast filling.+ Superb bundles. Free quality pre filter, the brass connector/valve is of very good quality and the hose is also of good quality.- The one main think I'm not happy about is the tap mechanism. It's cumbersome and not so easy to operate with one hand. Also feels bit flimsy. Above all this, the flow rate is slower than my Kent UV+UF Maxx systems normal white spring loaded tap. That one though looks plain, is very functional and a no nonsense design. This tap looks funky and irritates me all the time when I use it.- Slightly noisy. But still OK, since it's not very intrusive.Let's see how the long term service is. Installion was good. Will update post first service.

Only bluestar has some good looking ro. But there are some cons in build quality. The button pressing thing will come off after some days you have to use a tap to make it stiff. There will be a beep sound continuously when the power switch is on. Which btw annoying for some people but we didn't care about the beep sound as long the water is clean.

Manufacturing defects, light connectors and motor faulty.",1.0,"Was initially excited about it's good looks.It is priced economically compared to other similar brands like Havell, Usha, V guard.Installation was not very easy. Two screws used to hold the glass light holder wouldn't go in, so had to use appropriate size from my home stock. My society electrician fixed it and I paid him Rs. 500/-. The day after installing, the 4 lights started flickering and died out. Tested the bulbs, they were good. Called electrician again next day, and we realised that because of the movement of the fan as it rotated, the connection to lights had come loose. So used insulation tape to hold the connectors together and it was fine and lights sprang back to life. But in the evening, the fan would not move and produced a faint humming noise, and would rotate slowly with great dificulty only if a push was given. Called Orient customer care. No one turned up in the next two days. Complained to customer care and called the Area Manager for assistance. The technician finally turned up said that the starter winding or the motor winding may be faulty and he would have to take it to their service center for rectification. Told him to just take it down, as I wasn't sure how long it will work after repairs. Returned it to seller and requested refund. A waste of money paid for installation , my time, anxiety and disappointment. This is not something I bargained for from a company such as Orient.

Problematic product",5.0,"The overall experience of  this fan is horrible. For the first time when we received this fan , one of the  glass lamp was found to be broken for which Amazon gave us full replacement.The second fan didn’t had broken piece but after installation we found that the light switch is non functional. Now whenever I want to switch on the fan the lights will remain on .We tried contacting orient customer care but no response .Pathetic product and worst service .

Good Product but poor material of bulb holder",3.0,"The Fan is good with nice aesthetic look. However, as glass accessories is involved we are accepting more perfect packaging. It is preferred to have the length of chain up to 2 and 1/2 feet. One bulb holder was defective and was required to be replaced at our end. Hence it seems that the product is not fully factory tested. Overall fan is good, no need of regulator as the fan has inbuilt speed control. In fact if you install an additional regulator it can work as a dimmer for lamps as well, which brings an additional effect to your room.

Fastest water heating Geyser!!!",5.0,"Bought 25l solarium qube IOT couple of weeks back, being my first IOT geyser, tried all its functionalities. Found it the element heats the water from 41 deg to 55 in about six to seven minutes. Not sure how long it will take in winter. It’s neat and a change from the conventional cylindrical shape. The app is good and can control more than one of these geyser. Overall a complete satisfaction except one thing that’s it’s cable is bit short due to its coming out from the top of geyser and not bottom so before you install please check it out where your mains socket is

Water takes lot of time for heating, Good product but the installation procedure is little hectic",5.0,"The product came with free pipes but the installation crew were handling the product carelessly, they hit it to walls and door edges many times while working on with installation, i was very much worried about the product due to that. And also, the white cover over the temperature knob has got discolored as seen in the picture i uploaded with this review. Hope its not a used product. Otherwise, its good, will update review after a month of use.Edit after 5 months of usage:  We have to wait for atleast 35-50 mins after switching on the geyser for having a half bucket of hot water. After about 2-3litres of hot water the temperature of water changes back to normal from hot. And we have to wait for sometime again to get really hot water, other wise you have to bath with the lukewarm only.Moreover, because the geyser, our main switch was falling due to voltage overload. We had to change our main voltage capacity to avoid the main going off issue whenever we switch on the geyser. And also one cannot use other electrical appliances like mixer or washing machine along side this geyser cause it definitely is having voltage issues and lights go dim everytime,when we on the geyser while doing washing machine.

Crompton Geyser",4.0,"Overall the geyser looks good with great aesthetics. I bought the installation along with the purchase for extra 99 rupees which was much lesser than regular online booking for an electrician service. This was fulfilled by urban company.Pros: Looks great, and the water heated in 5-10 mins. Comes with solid big screws that goes deep into your wall, hence no worries about falling off.Cons: The geyser came without hanging hole to hold it on the wall, which the electrician created using a screwdriver. The metallic holder behind the geyser was fully concealed with plastic.

BEWARE!! Please don't go for positive reviews only",1.0,"Writing this review after 6 months of usage.Pros:BLDC Fan which saves electricityLooks goodEasy to install like any other fan.Have remote controlCons:Makes very much noiseThe range of remote is not goodThe fan stopped working after 6 months of usage and then started my horrible experience with Orient Customer care.I contacted their customer support to register my complaint. They said technician will visit soon. After 2 days technician visit and told me its PCB is damaged and need to be replaced. But it will take 4-5 days because they have to place request with company.After 5 days no one came to fix the PCB. I contacted customer support again and they provided me contact number of local service center. Customer support said now I need to contact the local service center only and they can't do anything in my case.I contacted the local service center and they told me that the order is already placed for my PCB and now they also can't do anything.Even after 15 days when part never arrived Local service manager gave me a phone number of the inventory manager.That guy was very rude and don't even have manners to talk. Said they will dispatch the part soon.Now if you can wait for 20-30 days for service then its okay or otherwise I'll suggest you go for some other brand because the service of Orient is Pathetic. The fan is very essential during summer time. Choose wisely.I thought Orient is a trusted brand but now I realize I made a horrible mistake.

High speed energy efficient fan",4.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Like: High speed fan with great looks and very light weight.Remote works fine but has to be pointed towards the fan. Air delivery is ok but never comparable with older fans. BLDC fans have different blade profile for energy efficiency which a slight sacrifice for lower operating cost.Dislike: Very poor customer service from Orient.Free installation not done and I installed it locally. Amazon had promised a reimbursement of Rs 200 which I am yet to receive even after 4 days.Very high noise level at speed 4 and 5 due to its high speed.Air delivery is concentrated and does not spread beyond 4-5 ft diameter.Update after 10 days use: The noise has reduced considerably and is now comparable with my old fans. Must have been from newly lubricated bearings. Speed is very fast and air flow has increased to normal .Bought three more fans in great Indian festival. There are many complain of high running noise. As per my experience this noise comes from freshly lubricated fan bearings which go away after seven days. So please do not return by the shrilling noise for first few days.Air delivery now appear to be comparable with my old fans at full speed.Energy consumption is one third which is a great advantage considering twenty hors running time per day for 8 months at Kolkata.

Extremely poor design. Flawed.",1.0,"Been using the Samsung semi-automatic machine for 11 years without any niggles. Changed to whirlpool for a change. (Samsung is still working fine).The machine itself is okay nothing special. But extremely poor ergonomics.1) The drain pipe is short and i mean like very short its shorter than the length of machine.2) the wheels are good to have, but the machine starts to move itself when washing is in progress. Excessive vibrations3) the water filling hose is very small in length and very flimsy material. Its less than even 1 meter.4) water hose connector is a specific type so only the small flimsy hose provided by Whirlpool can be used. Its a money making thing that brand use. First they make brand specific connectors and then mint money out of spares.5) the water connection is directly above the knobs panel. If even the a drop of water spills it will slide directly into the knobs and damage the machine. Again Whirlpool mints money in spares as it will considered as water damage and wont be covered under warranty.6) the water connection has 2 separate inlets 1 for washing other for spinning. Basically you will have to connect and disconnect everytime you need to send water from washer to spinner or vice versa. Whirlpool could have given a toggle switch as most brands have. This reinforces the fact that whirlpool has knowingly designed a machine so poorly that there is no way that it wont get damaged and whirlpool can mint money out of repairs.Its very evident that Whirlpool has knowingly added these design flawsI am surprised as to how this product has got an above 4 rating.This deserves a rating of no more than 2 at best.Worst ~10K spent.Repent not buying Samsung

Good, but I would have wanted to know...",3.0,"This is the first time I've ever used a semiautomatic washer/dryer instead of an automatic set and it is very easy.I live upstairs and could move the machine up the stairs with ease. There are a couple things I wish I knew beforehand though.1. There is hose that comes with it but it doesn't fit my water spout so I have to fill a bucket of water to dump into the washer.2. The dryer doesn't heat the clothes to dry, it only spins really fast to get excess water out.3. It doesn't rinse the clothes at all. I do a second wash cycle without soap after ringing the clothes out to rinse.4. The dryer is incredibly small compared to the washer. I doubt I could fit a comforter inside it.5. The dryer doesn't necessarily dry the clothes. It gets rid of excess water as stated before so after the drying cycle you still have to hang the damp clothes. During rainy season it'd be more difficult to get dry clothes but in the spring/summer months it's easy.6. Although it comes with a lint trap, it doesn't get any lint off the clothes so I'm going to have to invest in a lint roller. Which isn't a big deal, just a minor inconvenience.Overall it isn't noisy and beats doing laundry by hand. Also I feel the dyer cuts the outside drying time down by over 80%

Buy this product considering NO SERVICE!",1.0,"This product is a classic example of cheap quality product and service both. I purchased two split ACs in March 23 and we are having troubles with both and both aren't working. The worst is DAIKINs customer service numbers that never connects and their email id where no one responds. So it's better to purchase from local retail shops than Amazon or someone sitting 500KM selling you.

Good Product. BAD Installation",4.0,"Cooling is pretty ordinary. Bought it after seeing positive reviews from tech reviewers, but found it's performance to be at par with other ACs priced below ₹30k.The area where it really shines is the power efficiency. There is a significant difference between the power consumption of a 3 star AC and this one.The installation team charged Rs. 8000 for installation. My apartment needed around extra 8 foot copper pipe, they gave 12 feet. They are good at their job, but it's highly disappointing to see such a reputed brand is looting it's customers like this.

Good product but bad service",1.0,"I bought Daikin considering it is a Japanese engineering and believing in the quality. While the product itself is great, their service, it is given to 3rd parties who lack proper knowledge, professionalism and commitment or are not qualified to be called technicians. During installation, they came without vacuum pump, and when asked they were convincing me it is not required to vacuum. I had to literally explain them why we need to vacuum before convincing them to get the vacuum pump and vacuum during installation. They even charged me more from what was mentioned in the Amazon portal. After drilling for installation, they didn't even clean the debris. On another instance, I had raised request for maintenance, the technician called me, he said he would come in the afternoon and later I got message that my request has been raised for cancellation. The experience can be different in different cities, but at least in Calicut, the 3rd party who takes Daikin's work is pathetic at delivering their service. I own both LG and Daikin ACs, I had a Samsung AC in the past too,  I would say if you want great customer service, LG and Samsung will not disappoint. This rating of 1 is only considering the service experience which matters the most to me.

"Eagle Digital Pocket Scale with 600 g Capacity, 0.01g Accuracy - Small Weight Machine with Low battery, Overload Indicato...","5.0 out of 5 stars
Harmony of Precision: An Ode to the Eagle Digital Pocket Scale""",5.0,"The Eagle Digital Pocket Scale with its astonishing 600g capacity and 0.01g accuracy is truly a marvel of modern engineering, catering to the needs of precision enthusiasts across various domains. This small weight machine comes equipped with features that are bound to pique the interest of anyone with an affinity for meticulous measurement.Let's begin with the capacity and accuracy of this device. The 600g capacity is a testament to the extensive range of items you can weigh using this scale, from minuscule powders to more substantial objects. However, the real magic lies in its ability to provide accuracy up to 0.01g. For those unfamiliar with the significance of this level of precision, let me elucidate: one gram can be divided into a hundred parts, and each of those divisions is still detectable by this scale. This is essential for industries such as jewelry making, where even the slightest variation in weight can lead to significant differences in value.Now, let's delve into the design and functionality of this scale. The inclusion of a low battery indicator is a thoughtful feature that prevents interruptions during crucial measurements. Picture this: you're in the middle of weighing a delicate piece of gold, and suddenly, the scale shuts down due to a low battery. That's where this indicator comes to the rescue, saving you both time and frustration.But that's not all! The overload indicator is another remarkable addition. The scale is equipped with sensors that detect when the weight placed on it exceeds its capacity, preventing potential damage to both the scale and the items being weighed. This level of protection ensures the longevity of the device and the accuracy of your measurements.Let's shift our focus to the specific applications of this scale. While its utility in the world of jewelry and precious metals is evident, its value in the culinary realm should not be underestimated. Have you ever followed a recipe that required an exact amount of a particular ingredient? The Eagle Digital Pocket Scale eliminates the guesswork, allowing you to achieve culinary perfection. Be it spices, herbs, or even a pinch of saffron, this scale ensures that your recipes turn out consistently delicious.Furthermore, the scale's adaptability is exemplified by its use in laboratory settings. Researchers and scientists often require minute quantities of substances for their experiments. The scale's accuracy enables them to precisely measure these substances, contributing to the integrity and reproducibility of their work.The scale's application in the world of numismatics, the study and collection of coins and currency, is also noteworthy. Numismatists often need to weigh coins to determine their authenticity or grade. The Eagle Digital Pocket Scale's accuracy and portability make it an ideal companion for such endeavors.Now, let's talk about the technology underpinning this device. The scale employs strain gauge load cell technology to convert the force exerted by an object into an electrical signal. This signal is then translated into a digital readout on the display. The incorporation of such technology is a testament to the precision-focused approach that the creators have taken.The display itself deserves attention. Utilizing an LCD screen with backlit illumination, the scale ensures that readings are easily visible, even in dimly lit environments. This is especially crucial when working in jewelry workshops or laboratories, where proper lighting is paramount.The unit conversion feature of the scale is yet another detail that reflects its user-centric design. Users can toggle between different units of measurement, such as grams, ounces, carats, and more. This flexibility caters to various industries and applications, eliminating the need for manual conversions and simplifying the user's experience.Now, let's discuss the construction of the scale. It boasts a compact and sleek design, making it truly pocket-sized. Its portability is a boon for those who need to carry it from place to place, whether it's for business or personal use. The inclusion of a protective cover ensures that the delicate weighing platform remains safe during transit, preventing scratches or damage.Speaking of the weighing platform, its material and design are tailored to maintain accuracy and ease of use. The flat and stable surface ensures that items can be placed on it without any tilting or wobbling, leading to consistent readings. The use of high-quality materials also contributes to the scale's overall durability, making it a long-lasting investment.And let's not forget the power source! The scale is powered by batteries, and its efficient power consumption ensures that the batteries last for an extended period. This is crucial for individuals who rely on the scale for daily measurements, as it reduces the hassle of frequent battery replacements.In conclusion, the Eagle Digital Pocket Scale with its 600g capacity and 0.01g accuracy is a masterpiece of precision engineering. From its adaptability in various industries to its user-centric features such as low battery and overload indicators, this scale leaves no stone unturned in delivering an exceptional weighing experience. Its application in jewelry, culinary arts, laboratory research, numismatics, and beyond highlights its versatility.With strain gauge load cell technology, unit conversion capability, and a backlit LCD display, the scale embodies the synergy of innovation and functionality. Its pocket-sized design, protective cover, and efficient power consumption further solidify its position as a must-have tool for anyone who demands accurate and reliable measurements.In a world where precision matters more than ever, the Eagle Digital Pocket Scale stands as a beacon of accuracy, portability, and technological excellence. Whether you're a jeweler crafting intricate ornaments, a chef perfecting your culinary creations, a scientist conducting groundbreaking research, or a numismatist examining historical artifacts, this scale is your steadfast companion in the pursuit of precision.

Product good, but with unnecessary stickers on it",4.0,"The product itself works good, but what was the need of putting so many stickers on it? Could have instead put it in a clear bag and pasted the stickers on the bag, rather than the actual bottle, as removing them takes a lot of time and left some scratches as well, and it just adds to the frustration of using the product.

"Elica 90 cm 1425 m3/hr Filterless Auto Clean Chimney with Free Installation Kit (WD TFL HAC 90 MS NERO, Touch + Motion Sen...","5.0 out of 5 stars
Hassle free, filterless chimney with great suction power",5.0,"This model is a filterless Auto-clean model with 1425 m3/hr suction power. This being filterless solves 2 concerns immediately - no hassle of frequent cleaning of baffle filters like in a filter chimney and low maintenance in the long term.Looks: This looks good with modern looks and enhances look of your kitchen space. The feel is glossy, and the top body is easy to maintain and clean as well.Suction Power: This has one of the highest suction power(1425) in this segment and easily sucks fumes out of the kitchen. Please note you need to get the chimney installed at a correct height as per your cooking stove/hobs so that the fumes/odors can be captured properly. The installation guy will tell you the correct height for it depending upon your layout. Do ask him before hand.Filterless & Autoclean: I did a lot of research on the internet to understand filterless chimney vs baffle filters. A filterless chimney with an enhanced suction power like this and installed correctly is sufficient even for spicy, oily Indian cooking. A lot of internet links will say that for heave oil/spicy cooking, baffle filters should be preferred over filterless chimney, but its not the case. As long as you have regular Indian kitchen, a filterless chimney with proper suction power would perform better in your regular kitchen. You pay a marginal extra amount for a filterless chimney but save a lot of time, hassle and overall maintenance with it. You can just press the Auto-Clean button once in 2-3 months and all the excess oil is collected in the collector which can be easily removed and reattached. If you have a commercial Indian kitchen with very heavy daily usage, then you can go for baffle filter chimney. Baffle filters require frequent cleaning, need expertise in removal and then reinstallation and have higher maintenace in the long term.Lights: It comes with 2 led lights which properly illuminate the area under the chimney. I dont use it much because my kitchen has sufficient lighting anyways but sit is often useful, specially when cooking food in deeper vessels.Touch and Motion controls: Easy and flawless. Both work like a charm.Noise: The noise is as similar to a regular chimney even with having a higher suction power. On the highest selection level of 3, it can be a little more however it is tolerable.Installation Kit & Installation: The installation kit was included with all fittings. The aluminium pipe included in the kit can be extended till 8-9 ft. My outlet was a little farther due to my modular kitchen design and hence I paid 450 Rs extra for the extra pipe. The installation charge is 590 Rs so for me the total came out to be 590+450=1040/-. The installation guy provided an invoice for the same. Please note I already had a cutout done for the chimney as per the measurement and also the cutout for the exhaust pipe as per the measurement, by the carpenter beforehand. You should get it done in your kitchen as per chimney dimenstions. The diameter for exhaust pipe opening towards outside should by 6.5 inches.Elica Support: As soon as the product got delivered, I received an email from Elica asking me confirm the delivery and ready for installation in Bangalore (I think it is auto synced with Amazon). I replied to the email promptly, and i received a callback in 2-3 hours by evening confirming my availability and the installation guy came the next day to install the chimney. If you dont receive the email, you can call Elica customer care yourself and they will also be able to schedule the installation. Once the chimney is installed you will receive another call the next day to check your installation experience and also Elica Support Executive will cross check what were you charged for the installation including extras. Please note Elica uses authorised Service vendors to perform these installations. For me it was ""Go Service"" in Bangalore.Elica Mobile App: While your Amazon Invoice is sufficient as your proof of purchase for warranty, you can also install the Elica Mobile app (available on playstore) and register your product with the serial number, purchase date, and a picture of your proof of purchase invoice attached. Using the app you can also check for e-service manuals and also schedule service visits etc.Overall experience: Just go for it. I researched other Elica, Faber, Hindware, Prestige products but nothing beats this one.

A Convenient Cleaning Companion: AGARO Supreme Cordless Stick Vacuum",4.0,"I recently purchased the AGARO Supreme Cordless Stick Vacuum, and it has completely transformed my cleaning routine. With its strong suction power and practical, lightweight cordless design, this vacuum cleaner effortlessly maneuvers across various surfaces, making cleaning a breeze.The AGARO Supreme is a need for effective cleaning, thanks to its user-friendly features. The easy-to-empty dustbin saves me time and hassle, ensuring a seamless cleaning experience. Additionally, its sleek and stylish appearance adds a touch of elegance to my cleaning routine.However, there are a few aspects of the AGARO Supreme that could be improved. Firstly, I found that the vacuum is not very effective in pulling papers. It tends to get stuck in the nozzle, which can be frustrating. Secondly, while the lowest setting is great for dust, it may not be as effective for cleaning other types of debris. It would be beneficial to have more settings or adjustable suction power to tackle different cleaning tasks.Another area for improvement is the runtime on higher speeds. While the AGARO Supreme provides sufficient runtime on lower speeds, I would have appreciated a slightly longer runtime on higher speeds. Alternatively, the option of an additional battery for extended runtime would be a valuable addition.Despite these minor drawbacks, I believe that the AGARO Supreme Cordless Stick Vacuum is still a valuable cleaning companion. Its strong suction power, lightweight design, and user-friendly features make it a convenient choice for everyday cleaning tasks. It may have some limitations, but it excels in most scenarios.In conclusion, I highly recommend the AGARO Supreme Cordless Stick Vacuum for its overall performance and convenience. It has transformed my cleaning routine and made it much more efficient. While it may not be perfect for pulling papers or have the most ideal runtime on higher speeds, its benefits outweigh these minor inconveniences. Give it a try and enjoy a hassle-free cleaning experience.I hope you find this review helpful in making an informed decision about the AGARO Supreme Cordless Stick Vacuum. Happy cleaning!

For instant cleaning",5.0,"It is a powerful and handy vacuum cleaner. BUT only for short interval of time. And that is the only con of this vacuum cleaner. The best cleaning it does is on power mode and runs only for about 15 to 20mins. So one has to be very focused on where to use it for cleaning. Other than that it is very handy because its cordless and makes things very easy- just pick and start using instantly.  Easy to open its parts and clean. There is an extra filter given in the box. I didn't have any heating issues with the machine. And it makes the same noise as any other vacuum will make. Over all build quality of the product is good.

Comfortable and Easy to Use",4.0,"I recently purchased the AGARO Supreme Cordless Stick Vacuum Cleaner, and I'm happy to share my positive experience with it! Here's my review:Pros:Comfortable and Easy to Use: The lightweight design makes maneuvering the vacuum a breeze, especially with the 270° swivel head. It's comfortable to hold and use for extended cleaning sessions.Efficient Cleaning: I'm impressed with the suction power, especially on low mode. It effectively picks up dust, dirt, and pet hair from both hard floors and carpets. The various attachments allow for versatile cleaning in different areas.Long Battery Life (Low Mode): The low-power mode offers a surprisingly long runtime, which is perfect for regular cleaning tasks.Good Value for Money: Considering the features and performance, I believe the AGARO Supreme provides excellent value for its price point.Cons:Battery Life (Higher Modes): While the low mode offers good runtime, the higher suction modes drain the battery faster. This might be a concern for larger cleaning jobs.Noise Level: The vacuum can get a bit noisy on higher power settings, which might be bothersome for some users.

It has a strong suction power, have been using it mostly on the lowest setting as that itself is able to handle everyday cleaning. Cleaning the machine itself is also as easy as just shaking of the collected dust in the bin.

A nice cordless vacuum in budget",5.0,"Got it in prime day sale at 12k .I think it's a decent option for the people who are skeptical of going in Dyson price range. I am new to cordless stick vacuum cleaners so I wanted to start with a budget friendly model. It's good for small to medium house or flats. With floor brush attachment , it can easily suck everyday dust in low mode but for surfaces that are not maintained everyday, you have to use medium or high mode. Battery is ok for low and medium mode. But drains very fast in high mode. There is a room for improvement in battery capacity , charging time and spare battery in budget.

You can follow the manual, or I have also included my version of the instructions here.1. Base assembly with motor, plastic nut to secure back side grill, and shaft cap or spinner to lock the blade2. Screw and pvc gitti- 2nos each3. Front and back grill4. Plastic guard ring to fix and lock the grills/guard5. Wall clamp6. Warranty card/ Instruction manual in the same leaflet••••••••••••➕ PROS••••••••••••1. Modular design (I remember the previous generation of wall fans and the level of difficulty in assembling those)2. Sturdy and elegant design with metal guards and plastic body3. Good for air delivery up to 10ft. So small kitchens, washrooms, office cubicles, etc can be easily covered4. Has sufficient tilt for the said purposes (It can easily tilt vertically till 45 degrees from the vertical axis)5. Has a lock nut to secure its position while setting tilt (It has stepped slots for different tilt angles, so slipping possibility is minimal)6. Covers 60 degrees horizontal swing7. Pull down rope-based swing and speed control for easy access••••••••••••➖ CONS••••••••••••1. Airflow could have been better (~50 to 60 CFM- Cubic feet per min). Currently, its ~40 CFM, which is a bit low, as opposed to ~70 CFM for the 400mm model2. Swing rope requires extra effort, and you may confuse it for not working if you don't pull with force3. You end up paying a similar price for this 300mm fan as a 400mm one but ~50% lesser airflowFor the said cons, I will deduct 2 stars. But in any case, it's a 3-star device, as it is well suited for its intended usage in small rooms. There is a lot of room for improvement in price and performance.•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••⚙️ ASSEMBLY AND INSTALLATION•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••1. First check first if you have all the pieces to assemble2. Unscrew the spinner (used to fix the blade)3. Unscrew the plastic nut on the motor front (near the base of the visible shaft)4. Fix the rear guard by aligning the grooves to the motor base and use the plastic nut to secure it in place5. Gently push the blade on the shaft by aligning the pin on the shaft to a similar groove on the back side of the hole on the blade6. Once the blade is fully in, tighten the spinner on visible area of the shaft7. Loosen the plastic guard ring and put the front grill on top of the back grill8. Align both grills and ring, and tighten the screw on the ring9. Select the location and mark the mounting bracket's holes on the wall10. Drill and fix fan on the wallP.S. Don't tighten any of the plastic nut, spinner, or ring screw beyond a point; otherwise, it may slip. You need to find the threshold intuitively.••••••••••••••••🎛️ CONTROLS••••••••••••••••1. Set the inclination after loosening the knob on the right side of the motor, following the direction displayed2. Tighten the knob by rotating it in the direction displayed3. Use the left thread to switch on/off swing4. Use the right thread to switch the fan on/off and control the speed••••••••••••••••🏆 VERDICT••••••••••••••••This fan works ok if the room/cubicle size is small (within 7 ft x 7 ft dimension) and is a recommended buy.But, if space is not a constraint for the size of the fan, then definitely go for the 400mm model, as it offers 75% more airflow for the same price.

But in this egg boiler it is hassle free. Just follow the minimum instructions and rest will be taken care of by the boiler machine. Egg will be perfectly full or half or low boiled as u want, that too with auto timer.However my experience with preparation of making poach is not upto expectations. I shall have to experiment with it without following instruction booklet that made it almost like full boiled one with different shape of course.Easy to use and clean.

So you can buy it but still you have to make so much effort to make soft egg, medium boil and specially porched egg.

Useless, don't ever buy.",1.0,"I purchased this crap last year. I only used it for three months in the summer and then it was stored properly for the rest of the year. When I started it this year, I found that the water pump is broken, kaput. So much so for ""branded"" items. I used a local cooler for eight years without a hassle previously.The real shock was yet to come. The product page says 2 years warranty but the smart people at customer care are saying the warranty is One year only. My complaint was registered on 13/03/2024. Till date no progress has been made. I am being given various phone numbers for the regional service center and those people are either not picking up my calls or doing nothing. Hard earned money wasted on cool dream.

Noisy yet adequate cooling.",3.0,"I bought this cooler by the suggestion of VM One YouTube channel.The cooler is quite compact, it fits perfectly in the corner of a room and it's simple design is elegant. But, I feel it's a little short in terms of height, as I have to adjust the fins to get a direct air throw. The built quality is good and sturdy.The cooling part is a mixed bag, this is a small cooler with a small fan inside. Thus, it can cover only a small area. The area which it covers is comfortable and cool. But, it's not recommended for a large rooms.The major drawback is the noise levels, as the fan size is small it has run on a higher RPM. This results in fan sound, do not confuse with the wind sound, both are different. This is a high pitch sound which is annoying at times.For the price of 6k it's a decent purchase, but if you can increase your budget to 10k and have the space for a slightly bigger cooler, I would recommend a compact desert cooler, which has larger fan and higher air throw. This one is strictly a personal cooler, nothing more.

It sounds like an exhaust fan which is continuously turned On and irritating to the ears. Icebox is small and good for cubes only which melt in less then 5 minutes. It is strong, sturdy and easily movable. Good for personal use maybe only if you hear less in ears. Bcos it is noisy. A Wrong decision i have to live with i suppose... Just go to a shop look and buy such items instead of online shopping is what I have learnt.

 Good things- affordable-colour and design is goodBad things-Being a high speed fan, very noisy- few scratches on fan. Looks like unboxed- Paint quality was bad on one leaf (check picture). Paint will fall off in some time probably- should have provided one more nuts for each main screwsInstallation was easy. But had to remove and refit the designer part to remove the plastic protective covering. Blades and overall build is good. I will update if i face any problem in future.Noise is little high on full speed but you can  use 2 or 3rd speed to have enough airflow with less noise. Airflow is good but less spread like big fans. Ideal for kitchen.I received a product with minor scratches and paint issues. I don't want to return for that. But i recommend buying a branded one if you can afford. Have a great day

Delivered Damadged condition",1.0,"Don't waste your money to buy refrigerator from Amazon. They aren't customer centric what they used to be. I purchased LG refrigerator, it was delivered by Amazon cloud tail delivery team. The couple of guys brought my shipment at 11.00 hrs when i was in midle of offical work, they just placed the item and scanned the product and politely asked the OTP no. Since I had high regards with Amazon brand and trusted them they don't deliver the items with damaged condition so i just shared the OTP with them. Those guys havent performed open delivery which they supposed to do in front of the customer. They might aware this was already damadged before it's out for delivery. Exactly afterb1 hour I just opened the boxes then I found there is a significant dent on the rear side of the refrigerator, I was so terrified and initiated thebl replacement also contacted the customer servixe, explained him about the issue. The CS guy who keep on talking about the process and refused to replacement or refund, again I spoke to his higher offical, he was also spoke about the process, doesn't understand the pain from the common man point of view. I just told him if it is a open inspection delivery, the respective delivery guys has to open the box in front of us and get it signed by the customer also the service quality team has to physically checked the shipment and ensure everything is perfect before it gets out for delivery. I am sure nothing had been happend either. I was so frustrated with the service quality from Amazon my 5 years association with Amazon has been gone for toss. They weren't reliable what they used to be. As the brand going bigger on the other hand they were slipped from the great customer experience. They might colected feedbacks and photographs, it looks like most of them who purchased this item reported silimar issues however they didn't do any alternative solution to avoid this issue. My honest feedback is don't buy it from Amazon. I just spotted the dent and dont know how is going to work.

Faulty, Defective and doesn’t work.",1.0,"First of all, the product didn’t come with an instruction manual and so I spent quite some time searching for how to operate this piece. All that I could find was a small flow chart kind of thing on the carton and nothing else. While pealing off the cartridge’s seal as asked, I noticed a lot of particles/dust on the seal which clearly meant the filter was defective. Further, I noticed that the cartridge/filter wasn’t properly fit and while adjusting the same, I heard some rattle, similar the sound of grinding/crackling pepper. Nevertheless, I have added water to the jar from the top and and the water that was filtered through the cartridge was dark in colour with a lot of dark particles/suspended dust. It was kind of really scary. I wasn’t sure if that was normal, read online and learned that the water filtered through the cartridge was supposed to be clear since the cartridge is supposed to only change water’s pH and doesn’t actually add anything to water. Discarded the filtrate and tried once again but the same thing happened. The device is clearly defective and there’s no way you can return the same for a refund after purchasing, only a replacement can be sought and am not sure if that would work properly. Never expected KENT to deliver this kind of outdated, faulty, defective and rather dangerous thing without proper quality checks putting the health of customers at a risk and danger. Frankly, I am clueless what could have happened if I consumed the dark water with dark particles/dust.

 The product works for what it is designed for. I use it for toast over gas. It makes the crispy toast and veggies inside gets soft as well. But it is not the same as the one used by street side vendors which is dome in shape. That toast machine brings something different results. Also, the coating of this product comes off as and when you use it. Overall dont expect much from this product. It does the job okay but not that great quality product I would say. It could have been better if better quality coating and handle is used.

I'm impressed!",5.0,"Quite frankly, I was not expecting very much, but I actually ordered this for when my mother comes to visit in a couple of weeks. Thankfully, I wanted to have sandwiches today for lunch, so when this tool arrived, I was in a mind to use it as soon as I had washed it! Right out of the box, this is a very unassuming little tool...but don't let that trick you! I've used very high end panini grills, and this will get you the very same sandwich in your very own home as you would buy in high end restaurants!  Wearing far more comfy clothes, you can whip up quick food for guests, or just make simple meals when you're in a crunch for time! I agree with other reviewers, use this with a low flame and keep turning sides! I wish I had a picture of my first sandwiches, but just know they were toasted to perfection and made with only ingredients I truly wanted! Next, I plan to try this tool for making square pancakes. I had wanted a waffle iron in this same fashion, to use on my gas stove, but I'm willing to try this for my needs. This tool will stay open nicely, and then it stays closed nicely to properly distribute the steam that melts the cheese inside the bread while toasting the butter or oil on the outside! Washup was simple, drying is also simple as it fits nicely into our dish rack. With proper supervision and methods, this is safer for a young child to learn simple cooking than, say, a skillet. You'll need a silicone or wooden paddle/spatula so that you don't accidentally harm the coating. It came before expected, and I feel it was definitely worth our money!

Nice Product with Drawback",4.0,"Product is sturdy, does it's job. But, when you are making a product like this which gonna be use in foods, you have to think about cleaning properly. That's where i found it's drawback, you suppose to give a blade that is detachable to clean. Because from where the blade is coming out there are some spaces, which are tough to reach with fingers to clean. I have to clean those with wooden skewers. Brand like Prestige you are designing product like this not acceptable, just a request if you make another product like this in budget please provide this minor thing like detachable Blades, it will be easy for Moms, Grannies to clean easily.

Very nice and worth buying",5.0,"AC is effective, worth money paid, service by TANISHA REFRIGERATION, GURGAON, Is excellent. Got it installed same day when delivered. Installation person was cooperative.They charge little more( 2150/-) as compared to amount mentioned in service/installation on Amazon which was 1199/- plus GST. But provided bill for full amount paid so No issues.Out door Unit installation Stand was also not included in product so purchased separately for Rs. 700/-.But Product is worth buying specially warranty 5/5/10 on PRODUCT/PCB/COMPRESSOR, Also given in written by Amazon as on BLUESTAR PORTAL it was showing  01/05/10.Service provider was also supportive.Thanks Bluestar and Amazon.

 I liked the brand and purchased for its name and efficient working but to my luck I have received defective piece I have purchased on 22.4.24 since then it’s not working and I need to request the technician to visit for repair and they could not clear the L3error and cooling is also not good for even some time frequent problem in error L3 and observed sound in indoor unit also the technician not giving the perfect time to visit even after continuous calling and reminding also I request you to replace the defective piece with new working equipment due to summer heat we have purchased this to get relief but even after purchasing we are suffering a lot if not replaced immediately I may approach consumer court and we expecting that you would retain the brand value atleast

Pathetic AC and After sales service",1.0,"I purchased this AC unit with high hopes, but unfortunately, it failed to meet even the most basic expectations. Within just one month of purchase, the unit stopped cooling altogether. Frustrated, I promptly created a ticket for assistance, expecting a prompt resolution. However, to my dismay, not a single technician attended to the issue within the following week. Despite making multiple calls and attempting to escalate the matter through the website, I encountered nothing but roadblocks. The supposed channels for support proved to be ineffective, leaving me stranded with a malfunctioning AC unit and no viable solution in sight. This experience has been extremely disappointing, and I cannot recommend this product or the associated customer service to others.

Good value for money",5.0,"We had ordered for a Faber Chimney (60cm) which came in a sturdy package. The installation was done by the service person deployed by Faber on payment of 600/-. The pipe was brought by the Service person and costed 1500/-. Demonstration was given very well. It's an easy to use chimney, with buttons. The oil collector tray is easy to open and clean, which needs to be done every couple of months or so. Chimney looks good too, neat, and suitable for any kitchen. Suction is good. Overall it is a good buy with proper installation service from the Seller/Faber.

Some defects but working as of now",3.0,"The kettle looks sleek but there seem to be some design defects. The base and the bottle dont seem to fit exactly so that the entire contraction wobbles about when the water starts boiling. Then while pouring, hot steam which enters the handle thru the steam sensor hole makes the handle too hot. i had to tape the handle to insulate my hand from the hot handle. The switch doesn't fit the slot on the handle perfectly and i also noticed some water drops condensing on the inside of the switch on the handle.I used a Prestige kettle earlier which had much better workmanship. But these are all made in China anyway. i have nothing against China, here with the Wipro kettle there seems to have been a bad lot which possibly explains why the price is lower than that of other models offered by Wipro.This is a problem with shopping on Amazon that one gets sucked into price comparisons and going for the cheaper option which are mostly defective products without any disclaimer. In this case, i consciously went for this option on the hope that it would not be a serious defect. Lets see if my hope is allayed.

"LG 1.5 Ton 4 Star AI DUAL Inverter Split AC (Copper, Super Convertible 6-in-1 Cooling, HD Filter with Anti-Virus Protectio...","5.0 out of 5 stars
Amazing service experience!",5.0,"This costed me 35,615 in March 2024 after discounts and cashback. It is pricier that most other brands in 1.5 ton category but it also has some great features which make it worth the extra buck. Also note, if you buy it from Reliance Digital - it is the same overall price(after installation) but Reliance told me that this is such a fast selling model that they'll take 2 weeks to ship it to me. Amazon delivered it in 1 day!Pros:1. It is super compact - the 1.5 model is almost as small as a regular 1 ton model.2. it's very silent.3. It has a feature which allows it to function at 40% capacity(this is very useful if there's only 1 person in the room).4. It has a ""Viraat"" feature which allows it to function at 120% capacity allowing super quick cooling in hot conditions.5. It has dual inverter with full copper coil which leads to least amount of cooling loss and so cooling is amazingly efficient.Cons:I got the 3 star rated one(I always do as the electricity bill saving vs the additional cost of 5 star models doesn't make sense as per my use). However, the 3 star model does not come with Wifi or dual direction swing(meaning only up down swing is there, not left right). Since LG might as well have given these features in any model regardless of star rating, I feel these are LG's marketing tactics to convince customers to buy 5 star more pricier models. Since I don't see the point of either feature I decided not to spend the extra 7k for this.But my favorite part of this was the installation service. I ordered it on Thursday night in Bangalore, it got delivered on Friday morning, I got a call within 1 hour for installation and installation was done on Friday evening. Literally 1 day! The LG guys who came were super friendly, upfront about all charges, no hidden costs were added and they did a very clean job. I had to do a core cutting to install it which too the LG guys arranged for from their end through a local contact(who did an amazingly clean job of it). The installation cost was Rs.3500(for which I got a bill) and core cutting cost was Rs.1500(w/o bill as this isn't done by LG).

A fine air conditioner",4.0,"Though cooling is not that bone chilling like Daikin  but still if your room size is around 120 sq fit, it's one of the best choices.Why its cooling is not bonechilling? Because of its cooling capacity. It is just 4400watt which is around 700 watts less than the competition. Therefore even though lg is marketing it as a 1.5 ton AC it is actually 1.25 ton AC only and the worst part is even if it is less in capacity price is on par with the competition. So you are not getting what you are paying for. Price should be around 31k and they should market it as a 1.25 ton AC instead. Then only it will be one of the finest contender of that category.Other cons are not that significant but if I have to pick some...  it would be lack of wifi connectivity & no backlit in remote.My room is a small one. It is nearly around 120 sq feet. So my experience is fine apart from price. Build quality is fine. Noise level is astonishingly low. I use it at 28 degree with 40 percent capacity. All in all it is a solid 4 star in terms of functionality. 1 star is deducted for wrong marketing and enhanced price as per it's actual specification.

Dont Buy this AC: My experience in 1 month",1.0,"I recently purchased the LG Air Conditioner dual inverter AC, and it has been a thoroughly disappointing experience. Here's why I wouldn't recommend this product:1. Poor Cooling Performance: Despite the high price and impressive specifications, this air conditioner barely cools the room. Even at the lowest temperature setting, it struggles to make a noticeable difference, especially on hotter days.2. Energy Inefficiency: My electricity bill skyrocketed after using this air conditioner for just one month. It consumes an excessive amount of power, which is both environmentally unfriendly and expensive.3. Unreliable Performance: The air conditioner frequently stops working without warning. I've had to reset it multiple times, and customer service has been unhelpful in resolving these issues. It's clear that there are significant reliability problems with this model.4. Poor Customer Service: Speaking of customer service, my interactions with the company have been frustrating. Long wait times, unhelpful representatives, and no satisfactory solutions to my issues. It’s been a nightmare trying to get any support or assistance.5. In summary, the LG Air Conditioner dual inverter AC Air Conditioner has been a major letdown in every aspect. From its poor cooling capabilities and excessive noise to its high energy consumption and unreliable performance, I regret purchasing this product. Save your money and look for a more reliable and efficient air conditioner.please have a look at AC remote, even after runnning 3 hrs continuously, Room Temperature is 31 degree

Good product",5.0,"Good product, solidly built, 2 years guarantee from a reputable company. The vaccume cleaner does what it is intended for, that is light surface level cleaning through suction. The only downside is that one full charge is sufficient to vacuum clean the car once, I wish there was an option to operate by connecting the plug as well.Do not expect deep suction power from 'any' hand held, battery operated vacuum cleaner. All those people writing negative reviews are probably new to using vacuum cleaners. This product is meant for collecting debris as light as dust, hair, tiny shreds of paper, small food particles such as broken pieces of buiscits fallen in car or stuck in gaps etc. For anything more, you need a full size vacuum cleaner.I have multiple vacuum cleaners at home suitable for specific jobs and this one does not disappoint me for what it was intended to do.

It Traps Dust & Liquids Effectively. Doesn't Actually CLEAN",3.0,"Ordered this for my Parents who are senior citizens.Pros -1. Not very noisy2. Sucks in hair, pet hair, dust, Incense Ash very effectively from the Floor. Or any hard surface.3. Does not take up too much space.4. Cheap alternative to the Dustbuster Handheld Vaccum from (HNV220BCZ10FF) from the same brand.Cons -1. The vaccum is a little heavy for them, takes quite sometime to charge.2. Does not suck in dust, litter, pet hair, human hair etc from Carpets, rugs, or any kind of fabric except from a Cotton Bedsheet.3. Starts throwing out dust from a tiny vent which is near the On/Off button randomly, even if the dust collector is not full.Final verdict - Go for it if you have Cats & they drag their Litter out of the litter box.. This product will be a lifesaver. Go for it if you are looking for a handy vaccum cleaner with Wet & Dry function for trapping in very little amount of liquids/dust. But invest in a better Hand Held Vaccum if you really need to CLEAN surfaces/carpets etc.

Packs a punch",5.0,"I bought this vaccuum cleaner especially for cleaning the above_the_cupboard area which gets really dusty, the net on windows, and for sofas and upholstery.Frankly, after reading most of the reviews, I was a bit sceptical and almost didn't get this one. However, I went ahead and got it because my gut said so and also because this was amongst the most affordable cordless handheld vaccuum cleaners.I am now thrilled to bits - it's exactly what I was looking for, though I wish that the battery held a bit longer - I was able to clean three really dirty cupboard tops, windows in four rooms, and a bit of the sofa, from a single charge.It has more than adequate power to handle such jobs.Charging the battery is no issue coz i just leave it in one corner for 4-5 hours.All in all a superb purchase

Good suction power for the weight, very handy",4.0,"Update:Suction power 15.5 AW, which would be 806 pa (air).Suction pressure 370mm/water.From actual using experience I find suction good enough for a cordless but will be somewhat less than a corded full size W/D vac, may be this one has about 60% suction of a full size one guessing by the feel of it.Bought this for a typical use case I have:I use a broom to clean the dust on the floor as is typically done in Indian homes. However picking up & disposing that dust from the ground is a pain. Here comes this vac. Sucks up the dust in 10 seconds.I use it for a week like this and clear the dust & charge it on Sundays. I have found no simpler solution than this so far.The vac is simple to use & clean. No need to wet clean if you are not using to suck wet items.Also it is very handy, while doing something else if you see hair, dirt somewhere you can immediately suck that off. Advantage of small and cordless.Only downside is that it has no long protruding attachment. So can't go to narrow places - will not recommend cleaning car with this.

Don't buy waste of money",1.0,"This product was received damaged. Very poor customer support from amazon. Acid leaked from the battery which burnt my hands and damaged my home tiles. Even if bit expensive, buy batteries from the local market instead of amazon. Even after receiving a damaged product, Amazon doesn't have clear guidelines on which format to entertain customer issues. Initially, they asked me to share photos. When I clicked photos and shared them with them, they asked me to re-click by putting my name and date on the piece of paper. Once I did that and uploaded it, they said that my name is not matching with what they had in their system. My name in the app is ""Jaysinh"" and on paper, I had written ""Jaysinh Shukla"". Their customer support team was not able to rectify such minor things. Instead of understanding my issue, they forced me to re-click product photos in a system they expect. Again and again, I told them that this is an acidic battery and too heavy to take out of the box, and they were expecting me to perform the same repeatedly. Once I provided all details, I was requested to wait for 3 business days. Instead of three, it took 5 days. Even after that, I didn't receive any response from their customer team. I had to follow up with them repeatedly over a phone call. In the end, my money was refunded after multiple attempts. I had a very poor customer experience. Please don't buy this product from Amazon, instead, buy from the local market.

Does most of what is required.",3.0,"I've had it for a month so it is a first-use review. Make sure both the bowl and its cover are locked (you will hear a click) before you turn it on. The processor will not engage unless both are locked which is a good safety feature. I saw a couple of videos on how to use and change the blades on youtube (the Inalsa product videos are not really in-depth but some customers have really detailed ones). The chopping doesn't work well if the bowl is not full enough. I had about 4 onions halved and quartered that flew around merrily without any chopping. I did like the slicing and french fries though the slicing leaves enough of the veggie behind that you need to slice manually. The french fries won't be as thick as you buy in restaurants but I didn't want them as thick so it worked for me. I haven't used the atta kneader or other attachments. Cannot comment on how long the blades will stay sharp. The bowl is slightly thin plastic which is a bit concerning as it doesn't look very durable.Customer care for the product was very responsive which is a big plus. However, it is extremely annoying that you cannot register the product unless you upload a screenshot of your product review. I have taken a star off just for that little bit of bullying.

Good Overall Product",4.0,"Have been using it for an month now. One of the best OTG available for this price. I have used for toasts, roasts, reheat, dehydrate and grills. personally i like traditional ovens type - it really helps when you know the temperature and time to cook and you are good to cook anything to be specific!!pros:1. simple and elegant design.2. fits for most types foods (you might have to buy some accessories to use per needs)3. works fantastically well as mentioned.4. enough space for an entire chicken to be grilled inside. (personally my fav)cons:1. support ain't that great when you are approaching. luckily i haven't had any issues with the product. but general support wasn't on time. I requested a demo and received only a youtube link after a week.2. I highly doubt its space inside is 23L. perhaps the volume of the entire product is 23L.[finishing can be improvised, in terms of quality]

Damaged product.",1.0,"After 6 months, the machine is out of function. Nothing is working, and what's more surprising is the company isn't paying any heed even though it is within the warranty period. Since the last 1 month, they are saying they will look into the matter, however, no actions are being implemented from their side. This is the drawback of buying things online. Famous companies don't respond, fake marketing policies and betrayal of trust of customers.

It's by far the best brand I've used which beats the functionality and efficiency of other brands like prestige, pigeon or Philips. Even now, the heating is super quick, 3 litres of water can easily boil within 5 minutes. It's very handy for having ready hot water for compressions, cooking pasta or rice, cleaning purposes etc since it's so quick. Convenient, sturdy and great to look at.

 I purchased this pedestal fan and its stopped working within a month. When I attempted to contact customer support, I found that the provided numbers were unreachable. You can verify that the contact details on their website are not functional. They only respond via WhatsApp after you submit a warranty extension request, and even then, there has been no follow-up on my queries. Despite trying for over a week, I haven't received any response. Additionally, the website is not functioning properly. I strongly advise against buying this product, even if it seems affordable, as the lack of reliable service support means you will have no recourse if the product fails. Opt for a reputable brand with established service centers and dependable support.

Good cooling, but no memory function",4.0,"The ac cooling is good. The ac doesn't have memory of the previous setting and starts on default setting.The ac has wifi connectivity and connects with its app. The app is useful for regular functions and scheduling. But cannot track usage or electricity consumption yet.The app also shows humidity levels as well as current room temperature which the AC does not display on the indoor unit..The wind free mode is really useful at nights especially for folks who don't want the chilling wind blowing onto them always.

Its works good",4.0,"I Used before embassy percolator 6cups, was heavier in mettle and glossy in finish, The reason I ordered this was coz my previous percolator was leaking water from the safety valve.  HERE i want to give checkpoint to all readers * which I get from Embassy, they suggest after listening to my issue - if the steam leak from a valve, it may chock of percolator's neckline or tiny holes may block of filter, clean first that pipe with via removal of below gasket and filter clean, with thin bottle brush available for clean especially this narrow pipe. most of the problem get resolve with cleaning. as i resolved mine.  they told - if water also starts leaking it can be the defect and need to replace valve which is available with them .. i find it is a big support.also, I find of this percolator have a sleek upper body part and also very Important in buying decision, practically it is not 500ml, less than 400 ml and below safety valve water can come around 300ml, and Upper body can hold only this 300 ml amount of water. But the price is good, and thinking if it supports to filter coffee making for next couple of months, it will be more than good.and finally after twice trail, i find the defect in joining of two cups continues leakage of water and steam and its pure defect. so i prefer return.

Delivered Damadged condition",1.0,"Don't waste your money to buy refrigerator from Amazon. They aren't customer centric what they used to be. I purchased LG refrigerator, it was delivered by Amazon cloud tail delivery team. The couple of guys brought my shipment at 11.00 hrs when i was in midle of offical work, they just placed the item and scanned the product and politely asked the OTP no. Since I had high regards with Amazon brand and trusted them they don't deliver the items with damaged condition so i just shared the OTP with them. Those guys havent performed open delivery which they supposed to do in front of the customer. They might aware this was already damadged before it's out for delivery. Exactly afterb1 hour I just opened the boxes then I found there is a significant dent on the rear side of the refrigerator, I was so terrified and initiated thebl replacement also contacted the customer servixe, explained him about the issue. The CS guy who keep on talking about the process and refused to replacement or refund, again I spoke to his higher offical, he was also spoke about the process, doesn't understand the pain from the common man point of view. I just told him if it is a open inspection delivery, the respective delivery guys has to open the box in front of us and get it signed by the customer also the service quality team has to physically checked the shipment and ensure everything is perfect before it gets out for delivery. I am sure nothing had been happend either. I was so frustrated with the service quality from Amazon my 5 years association with Amazon has been gone for toss. They weren't reliable what they used to be. As the brand going bigger on the other hand they were slipped from the great customer experience. They might colected feedbacks and photographs, it looks like most of them who purchased this item reported silimar issues however they didn't do any alternative solution to avoid this issue. My honest feedback is don't buy it from Amazon. I just spotted the dent and dont know how is going to work.

The fridge is really BIG",5.0,"Happy with Amazon's amazing delivery team who deliver the product ontime and without any damages. Packing was impressive from Samsung's side.Though it's plug and play, we placed an installation call with Samsung and by 3 hours engineer  came down for demo and warranty registration. Quite fast.Engineer asked to use the fridge atleast 5 hours from delivery as that gives coolent to settle which was disrupted due to transit.The fridge is too big. Love the colour. The shelves are made of glass and looks to be strong enough to handle weight. This will prove in due course when we will put lots of stuffs inside.The key can be placed on top of the door left corner, which many people miss out.The only thing I didn't like is the place which holds the water bottles. They are meant for 2 liters bottle,  but if we keep one liter bottles we can't keep more than 3 as there are partitions/dividers in those shelves meant for 2 liters only.Sound is very low, not at all bothering.  Can be label as silent fridge.This model comes with a coolpad. Normally most of the fridges dose not have this option.Base drawer is good. Can store couple of kgs of potatoes, onions and vegetables which don't need refrigeration.The veg box is OK type. Good to store a week's supply for 3 adults.Just 1 day old... Will review again post 1 month usage.

Beautiful spacious refrigerator",5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Very very nice refrigerator, very sharp cooling made ice within half hour . Very attractive fridge with very good space. Base basket for storing dry vegetables. Great capacity. Looks attractive from inside. PURCHASED on 09th June 23 with great discounts for rupees sixteen thousand only.This fridge have a cooling pad which keeps dairy items chilled for nine hours when there is no electricity. You just keep cooling pad inside the fridge and keep dairy items on it, it will keep cool these items for nine hours when there is no electricity. There is one red spot in the freezer compartment which means that if one sees it covered with ice must defrost it. At night must check to no2or 3 as the door is not opened at night frequently. Defrosting should be done every 3 days. These direct cooling refrigerators have more capacity than double door frost free.Must start fridge after 4 hours of delivery because the gas in compressor takes time to settle.Samsung is a very reliable and trusted company.I recommend buy for this refrigerator.

I tried cushioning it with a layer of cloth. Didn’t work then I tried using a bubble to line it from within. Worked fine for a few days and as the bubbles gave way the grip slipped again.The Velcro is non adjustable so while it might work for some it certainly didn’t for our fridge model.Still love the looks of it so what if it keeps slipping to the bottom of the notch.

Disappointed with this model",1.0,"If you are looking for a fridge to keep food then PLEASE do not buy this fridge...This model ONLY is suitable for keeping water, juice, milk or any liquid items or some vegetables.If you keep any cooked food it will stink the next day. Beware ⚠️I have been using this for past one month and I am not able to store or keep any cooked food items in it. I called up the customer service person and he came in and told the fridge doesn't have any issues this fridge purpose is only for making liquid items like juice or milk cold  andnothing else.I was like schoked. I said this is nothing mentioned in your advertisement or manual. And he said yes the company does not detail this on their advertisements. He even said he got similar complaints from other people who brought the same model fridge.Really a bad experience from Samsung. I wonder why would Samsung build a fridge only to keep liquid items..? That's strange. Isn't it ?Another worst thing about this fridge is the small freezer box inside  the fridge frosts up heavely and I have to defrost the freezer atleast 2-3 times a week which is kind of awkward. 2-3 times a month yes practical but 12-15 times a month not at all practical.The only positive I could say regarding this fridge is that it is big and has ample space. Suitable for a family of 2or3. The second is the colour. I like the colour very much. The remaining all are its negatives. Rite now I have no idea what to do with this fridge. To be honest this has been a waste of money. The old fridge I had was much much better 😞

This fridge's leveling period for power consumption is 1St January 2023 to 31 Dec 2024. Manufactured on 2023.Very fast and helpful in time delivery from Amazon and good behaviour. Thanks for that.After using 30 days I am writing this review. Purchased on first week of March 2023.My family is satisfied with its parformance till now.Edit after using one year.Today, 26th of March 2024The fridge is now one year old. No problem with it, runs smoothly. Our home is near the rever Ganga and the area having moisture content in the air. It use to make defrost every 2 or 3 days. And we simply switch off from the board, we don't use it's defrost button. The water container of the back side is small in size so overflows sometime.It lowers our monthly power consumption even it runs 24x7.Thank you Samsung.

When reported for service they took the machine and returned after weeks saying it's corrected and even the main control board is replaced.

Efficient and User-Friendly Vacuum Robot, but Not Worth the Price",4.0,"I purchased the device a month ago, and I must say, it has significantly lightened the cleaning workload for my mother in our 1300 sq ft house. This device is incredibly easy to program and use, making it a convenient addition to our household chores. While it has its limitations, overall, it has proven to be a good buy.One of the standout features of this vacuum robot is its user-friendly interface. Programming it is a breeze, allowing us to effortlessly schedule cleaning sessions according to our needs. Its performance has been commendable, efficiently navigating through our home and leaving no corner untouched. The device lives up to its promises and delivers the expected results. At times, it's confused. But again, it's easy to bring it back to its senses.Maintaining the vacuum robot is also hassle-free, as it is easy to clean. This saves us valuable time and ensures that the device remains in optimal working condition. The customer service during the installation process was decent, providing a satisfactory and convenient experience.However, the mopping feature of the robot falls short of expectations. While it can effectively be used once a week, the frequent refilling required to cover our entire house is inconvenient. It demands at least three refills, which can become tiresome over time. Although it serves its purpose, there is room for improvement in this aspect.Additionally, the battery life of the vacuum robot could have been better. While it is sufficient to clean the house twice on a single charge, an extended battery life would have been appreciated. However, it is worth noting that the suction power of the device is exceptional. I have never seen the floors so clean in ages, and it truly justifies the purchase.On the downside, despite offering four different modes, including a ""silent"" option, I was disappointed to find that it did not live up to its name. The noise level remained nearly identical to the ""Standard"" mode, which was unexpected. It would have been ideal if the ""silent"" mode truly provided a quieter operation, allowing the device to clean the house without disturbing the peace. Unfortunately, it fell short in this aspect.Nevertheless, considering the impressive suction power and the overall effectiveness in cleaning, I still believe that this vacuum robot is worth the purchase. It efficiently reduces the workload, leaves the floors spotless, and offers convenient programming and scheduling options. Despite the minor flaws, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, making it a worthy investment for a cleaner home.Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that my mother, who is over 60 years old, has been able to handle and use the vacuum robot without any issues. Its user-friendly design caters to different age groups and abilities, making it accessible for individuals like her.In conclusion, this vacuum robot has been a valuable addition to our household, significantly reducing the cleaning workload and providing convenience. However, the limitations of the mopping feature and the questionable value for money prevent me from giving it a full endorsement.

VFM",5.0,"All is Well with this Vacuum, except some software glitches that cause the Robot to Disconnect from the Wifi even being within 5m of the range of the router. Causing it to spin on the spot till reconnection is successful. Battery lasts for almost 2 full house vacuum and mops (house is approximately 30m²). Cleaning the tanks (Dry and Mop) is a regular chore, the central brush has to be cleaned at least once in 3days (I don't have pets, so it isn't so frequent cleaning for me).If only Xiaomi could work on the Network Connection Glitch and source a stability update. Otherwise it is bang for buck for the Premium Features at Affordable Price. Others in its competitors do the same work but ask a premium of 8-10K more than this one's price tag

Frustrating experience",1.0,"On the day of purchase, it had problem during the initial setup where an error message was playing telling me to ""place the mop on the floor to start"". However, after a full charge, the error disappeared and i didnt face this problem again.This was working perfectly for the past 1 month without any issues but recently, the same issue showed up again. This time, error did not disappear ever after a full reset or a full charge.I submitted a complaint with Mi customer service and while i did get a call from them a week later, they were not at all helpful.The person who called mentioned that he does service only for water purifier and that he will forward the complaint to the service center.  I didnt hear back from him or the service center after 2 weeks and when i called him back, he told he will share the contact details but i havent received any yet. Hence, i have logged one more complaint on the website now.This is beyond frustrating and i regret not having replaced this when the issue first appeared on the day of purchase as it would have been much easier.Moreover, the standby battery life is also bad. After a day of inactivity, it would drain all the battery and hence i have to keep it charged the whole time.My advice would be that if you find any issues that has the potential to cause a big problem in the future, its better to replace it before Amazon's replacement window closes. Amazon replacement is far better than running behind the miserable customer service that mi offers.Update: After 3 months of constant follow up calls, e-mails and escalations, i finally received a new replacement unit today. Finally a relief. But seriously, don't buy it. The service is still the worse and the only way to get a solution is relentless badgering untill they do the needful.Also, one thing that i noted is that this is not a Xiaomi made product. It is actually manufactured by Viomi which is imported by Xiaomi.(it was mentioned in the box which i noticed only now)Update 2: The replacement unit is now dead. It worked for less than a week. This time, the issue is that i cannot power on, power off, or even factory reset the product. Again i have contacted customer service and who knows how long will it take this time.Again I'm repeating. Never buy this product. Its a waste of your time and money.I'm planning to file a complaint to consumer court to get the amount refunded. There is no other way to escape from this hell.Update 3: I again received a new replacement unit. This time, it was fairly fast as they were able to see my previous complaints because of which they directly escalated it to the back end team. The new unit is working as of now. Hopefully this has a long life. One thing that I learnt is that when the service request is delayed, try as much as possible to get the query to the back end team. Once the ticket is assigned to them, the resolution will be much faster.

 You can check in the video: IP 200V OP 241V; i.e. almost 20% INCREASING CAPACITY. Build quality is descent enough. If you want a fancy one, there's a PEARL VERSION of it. Product doesn't come with installation facility in most of the PIN CODES.Stabilizer runs quite soundless, if there's a step up required then you can hear a single ""khat"" sound.Time delay facility available, 10 secDisplay is PURPLISH WHITE, Visible, Bold enoughOverall GOOD PRODUCTIf you're living in an urban area where the voltage fluctuation is minimal; you can go for this 160-285 V range; no need buy 90-300 or 130-280V etc.

Don’t buy unless you want to change your ac too",1.0,"This stablizer is pathetic. The issues re listed down1) it will constantly overheat show error OHT and shut down your ac. The problem was not ac the problem was this particular stablizer all other acs and stanlizers in home (15) are working fine.2) even at normal voltage it will give low voltage to your ac leading to compressor shut down and after repeated shutdowns your compressor will take a hit.3) the customer care numbes have been disconnected. Only way to reach Microtek is through their WhatsApp no on which they respond after one week. Seems like the company is not doing well enough to have customer care team.I ran from pillar to post with O general trying to figure out why my ac was not able to cool efficiently despite perfect compressor and gas and thermostat. Turns out the problem was this stablizer all along.U still want to waste your money, all the best

I didn't like the way Microtek has cut costs",3.0,"Excellent value for money considering the build quality and features (metal body, digital display etc). I noticed a few things when using this voltage stabilizer-1. The input and output voltages shown on the display are approximately 4V lower than the actual value as measured by a multimeter. However, this is not a defect as this is well within the calibration accuracy of 2.5%.2. The power cable is only 1 sq. mm which is too thin for a 1.5 ton air conditioner. Even a voltage drop of only 0.5V causes a power dissipation of almost 4 watts in the wires. The cable gets a bit warm after a few minutes of running the AC.3. Some reviews here incorrectly mentioned the power cord being aluminium, but it is copper with tin-coated endings. For those of you who don't know, you can't connect aluminium wires directly to the brass terminals of normal plugtops. The aluminium will corrode (galvanic corrosion between dissimilar metals) and burn out in a matter of days.I wanted to give this stabilizer five stars but had to reduce two stars for not providing thicker wires. Having 2.5 sq. mm would have been ideal, but 1.5 sq. mm should be fine too. I would have returned it had they used aluminium wires.

Perfectly works",5.0,"Very good product. It's really controls Voltage for 1.5T AC. Step up and Step down Voltage capacity is +/- 40V approx which is most important to know first, means when input Voltage is 190V it's produces (190+40) = 230V approx and when input Voltage is 250V it's produces (250-40) = 210V approx.

Not recommended for SERIOUS COOKS ( home-makers ) , few ""bare necessity"" functions are missing !!",3.0,"Ordered the stuff with ""2 day delivery"" option & received it in 20 hours , so its 'amazing amazon' as always .Coming to the product .I have tested it for last 2 days & need to watch more ( reliability / durability ) . I have used Prestige & Bajaj 2000 watts ( each performed great & lasted 2 years ) , so my expectations were pitted against those products .My first impressions of this Pigeon product :1. Built quality looks & feels OK for the price point . Chrome-rimmed buttons give a sleek look & the button-pressing feels good .2. Fan noise level is DEFINITELY IRRITATING .. at least 30-40% HIGHER than similar products !!I suspect its because they use a SINGLE SPEED fan , which runs continuously at the same noise level !!Cooling rate is slow too . Even after switching off the unit ( after 30 minutes cooking ) , the fan continues to run for 15-20 seconds3. The cooktop ceramic is NOT GLAZED and looks a bit tacky . Though the dull finish does help in not allowing small steel bowls ( tea heating ) to slip left-right ... a definite headache with my Bajaj ICX8 .Not glazed also means MORE PRONE to getting stained ( turmeric spills ) . User Manual suggests TOOTH PASTE to remove stain ... hmmm :)4. Length of Power Cord is definitely SHORT ... short by at least 1-2 feet compared to similar products , which is a REAL TROUBLE for me since my plug point is placed high up . Using Extension Cord is NOT a good idea for a 1800 watt item . User Manual WARNS too .5. Base legs are NOT ANTI-SKID like Bajaj / Prestige . The cooktop SLIPS LEFT-RIGHT by the slightest pressure .The unit DOES NOT STAY FIRM ON ITS LEGS WHILE COOKING WITH SWAYING SPOON / SPATULA !! What a shame :)6. Does not have a KEEP-WARM / HOT-POT function !! What a terrible design miss !!So, in effect , SLOW & LENGTHY ""COVERED"" COOKING ( for delicate meat dishes ) is RULED OUT !!This is an ABSOLUTE DEAL BREAKER for serious cooks like me !!Lowest wattage setting is 400 watts ( what a joke ) , though I found some ""functions"" ... at 80 watts ( milk heating ) & 180 watts ( saute ) , but looking at the heat generated at those settings , it is certainly not HOT-POT heat which is needed for tender cooking !!7. User Manual is BOGUS and ""somehow"" drafted . Beginners wont understand A THING and would blame the product for their OWN mistakes .My first impression tells me I will be more & more disappointed as time goes by .A cheap option for bachelors .... but NOT RECOMMENDED for savvy housewives who take cooking SERIOUSLY .

Airflow too low and increases humidity in the room even when the window is open.",1.0,"Recommended by brand for around 100sft which most probable has only 1 window. It doesn't cool well and increases humidity, skin becomes sticky and irritable. If you're room has 2 or more windows and doors are all open, then it'll cool the room.Don't think that the out-flow window is as big as the area of the blades. It is not. It's out-flow window in only around 4"" × 6"", which is only enough for one person, even if the side to side movement is on. If you're sitting on a chair, it can cover your upper body or the lower body. There are no 5 filters as they mentioned. Only the dust filter is as mentioned. Honeycomb pad is only half the height of inlet windows and there's this green plastic mesh, which looks like a loofah material. The other 2 filters doesn't exist at all. Overall, don't buy it, period. Choose something from a trusted brand and in my opinion this lost my trust. Visit a store if you can to test them personally before purchasing.

NOT at all EFFECTIVE. Slightly better than a Stand/Table Fan. MISISNG the COOL factor",2.0,"IT IS NOT AT ALL EFFECTIVE. I can compare this with a Stand/Table fan where this is slightly better than that be it aesthetics or in terms of cooling as well. Doesn't feel at all that its an ""Air-Cooler"". Good blow of air but the ""Cool"" factor is almost missing. May be when the temperature rises, it will give an illusion of cooler air than the one from the ceiling fan, and may give some quick/temporary relief ""Psychologically"" but do not expect any comfort per se. Swing operation works, but it will actually become added DISAdvantage, because when the direction turns aways from you, you will really feel the heat, may be when it comes back you will feel better but for couple of seconds :).You need to train your mind to accept that this works for you.

Top notch product with really good features and best performance.",5.0,"I am really liking this water purifier so far. Been using it for 2 months now and so far no issues. It took me time to adjust to the taste of the water but compared to other RO's that I've used before, the taste is pretty good.Hot water is also a pretty good feature especially in winters, you can store 800ml of hot water and use it to drink or your morning coffee. I also love the light it throws in your container while filling water, makes my cup glow and the kid in me really likes it.One thing that bothers me so far is the beep sound that happens every time you press the button to fill up, it's annoying when you're trying to drink water late night, I don't know if there is any option to turn it off but it's just me nit-picking.Overall it's a 5 star product and everything from build quality to ease of use to feature list is top notch.

Water tastes good .They have a seperate app for service . So once you register a complaint , a service boy would be assigned in no time and they will give you a call . Service is actually fast.Overall would definitely recommend this product .I know the maintenance is high but it's worth it, definitely worth it.

Got a nice product",4.0,"AO Smith Z9 a good water filter as it has both hot and normal water options which is quite helpful for the days which require hot water for seasonal changes.hot water for 45⁰ require 2 minutes and for 80⁰ require about 6 min to heat. Everything is good but it only runs on electricity whenever there is no power supply we can't get water out of it as it works only when power supply is there regarding that everything is good and perfect.Thank you.

 It’s an excellent product as far as appearance is concerned, looks durable, ease of use & installation !!!It also produces excellent sound like my bike !!! But there is no airflow 😎.At the highest speed a very little breeze is felt. Other company fans - Previously I have been using Rico portable battery fan also bought from Amazon- I had to change it as I had already used it for almost 5 years.I realised this issue of sound effects only after 2/3 days of usage by the time I had disposed off the packing, else I would have returned it ! Now I am trying to buy a better fan blade for replacement ‼️

Good fan for a small room, but go for the 400mm model if space is not a constraint",3.0,"I earlier had a 200mm high-speed fan for the kitchen, but it burst into fire one day. I searched for wall fans considering space constraints and settled for a 300mm model.So far, this fan is serving its purpose and working well (Mostly, I use it at full speed as the air requirement is at around 6ft to 7ft distance). But yes, don't miss out on the details below and the final verdict.•••••••••••••••••••🎁 INSIDE BOX•••••••••••••••••••The fan comes in a disassembled state, but it is pretty easy to assemble, owing to a modular design. You can follow the manual, or I have also included my version of the instructions here.1. Base assembly with motor, plastic nut to secure back side grill, and shaft cap or spinner to lock the blade2. Screw and pvc gitti- 2nos each3. Front and back grill4. Plastic guard ring to fix and lock the grills/guard5. Wall clamp6. Warranty card/ Instruction manual in the same leaflet••••••••••••➕ PROS••••••••••••1. Modular design (I remember the previous generation of wall fans and the level of difficulty in assembling those)2. Sturdy and elegant design with metal guards and plastic body3. Good for air delivery up to 10ft. So small kitchens, washrooms, office cubicles, etc can be easily covered4. Has sufficient tilt for the said purposes (It can easily tilt vertically till 45 degrees from the vertical axis)5. Has a lock nut to secure its position while setting tilt (It has stepped slots for different tilt angles, so slipping possibility is minimal)6. Covers 60 degrees horizontal swing7. Pull down rope-based swing and speed control for easy access••••••••••••➖ CONS••••••••••••1. Airflow could have been better (~50 to 60 CFM- Cubic feet per min). Currently, its ~40 CFM, which is a bit low, as opposed to ~70 CFM for the 400mm model2. Swing rope requires extra effort, and you may confuse it for not working if you don't pull with force3. You end up paying a similar price for this 300mm fan as a 400mm one but ~50% lesser airflowFor the said cons, I will deduct 2 stars. But in any case, it's a 3-star device, as it is well suited for its intended usage in small rooms. There is a lot of room for improvement in price and performance.•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••⚙️ ASSEMBLY AND INSTALLATION•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••1. First check first if you have all the pieces to assemble2. Unscrew the spinner (used to fix the blade)3. Unscrew the plastic nut on the motor front (near the base of the visible shaft)4. Fix the rear guard by aligning the grooves to the motor base and use the plastic nut to secure it in place5. Gently push the blade on the shaft by aligning the pin on the shaft to a similar groove on the back side of the hole on the blade6. Once the blade is fully in, tighten the spinner on visible area of the shaft7. Loosen the plastic guard ring and put the front grill on top of the back grill8. Align both grills and ring, and tighten the screw on the ring9. Select the location and mark the mounting bracket's holes on the wall10. Drill and fix fan on the wallP.S. Don't tighten any of the plastic nut, spinner, or ring screw beyond a point; otherwise, it may slip. You need to find the threshold intuitively.••••••••••••••••🎛️ CONTROLS••••••••••••••••1. Set the inclination after loosening the knob on the right side of the motor, following the direction displayed2. Tighten the knob by rotating it in the direction displayed3. Use the left thread to switch on/off swing4. Use the right thread to switch the fan on/off and control the speed••••••••••••••••🏆 VERDICT••••••••••••••••This fan works ok if the room/cubicle size is small (within 7 ft x 7 ft dimension) and is a recommended buy.But, if space is not a constraint for the size of the fan, then definitely go for the 400mm model, as it offers 75% more airflow for the same price.

The battery back up is quite decent and works beyond my expectation, about 3 - 4 hours of fan in mid speed for a full charge.The led light is quite bright and works really well. The design is quite pleasing and the overall plastic finish is good. My only irritant is the switches, they are hard to press and also speed selection is in sequence, one has to go through low, med and then to reach high not directly. A rotary speed selection could have been provided. But for the cost it is a great product.Highly recommended.Also you can charge your phone using a usb cable....

 Liked the Output of this purifier. Aqua D Pure is an Indian firm. They are providing this excellent purifier at very affordable price.I found water to be sweet. It wastes less water. Installation was easy and technician was very helpful.I would like Aqua D Pure to look into below area:1. Quality of build of plastic should be improved2. Purifier motor is giving a bit of noise as evident in video. This can definitely be made a bit less silent.The above are not major drawbacks or shortcomings considering the price of the product. I would still recommend to purchase itHope that helps.

A must have for people having expensive cloths, shoes, cameras and all stuffs like that",5.0,"So when I bought my new dslr. I knew very less about fungus and how it effects our camera. So my camera and lens ended up getting fungus. And I hade to spend a lot of money and man-hours to get rid of them. The Camera-Pros adviced me to buy a camera dry cabinet which costs around 5-7k min. Then I found this absorbers. And believe me this works more than fine. I keep my camera with my cloths and shoes in a wodden almira with 1 absorbent pack. And it keeps all my stuffs moister-free and fresh. This is my 2nd time purchasing this. Its worth every penny..

The fridge is really BIG",5.0,"Happy with Amazon's amazing delivery team who deliver the product ontime and without any damages. Packing was impressive from Samsung's side.Though it's plug and play, we placed an installation call with Samsung and by 3 hours engineer  came down for demo and warranty registration. Quite fast.Engineer asked to use the fridge atleast 5 hours from delivery as that gives coolent to settle which was disrupted due to transit.The fridge is too big. Love the colour. The shelves are made of glass and looks to be strong enough to handle weight. This will prove in due course when we will put lots of stuffs inside.The key can be placed on top of the door left corner, which many people miss out.The only thing I didn't like is the place which holds the water bottles. They are meant for 2 liters bottle,  but if we keep one liter bottles we can't keep more than 3 as there are partitions/dividers in those shelves meant for 2 liters only.Sound is very low, not at all bothering.  Can be label as silent fridge.This model comes with a coolpad. Normally most of the fridges dose not have this option.Base drawer is good. Can store couple of kgs of potatoes, onions and vegetables which don't need refrigeration.The veg box is OK type. Good to store a week's supply for 3 adults.Just 1 day old... Will review again post 1 month usage.

Beautiful spacious refrigerator",5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Very very nice refrigerator, very sharp cooling made ice within half hour . Very attractive fridge with very good space. Base basket for storing dry vegetables. Great capacity. Looks attractive from inside. PURCHASED on 09th June 23 with great discounts for rupees sixteen thousand only.This fridge have a cooling pad which keeps dairy items chilled for nine hours when there is no electricity. You just keep cooling pad inside the fridge and keep dairy items on it, it will keep cool these items for nine hours when there is no electricity. There is one red spot in the freezer compartment which means that if one sees it covered with ice must defrost it. At night must check to no2or 3 as the door is not opened at night frequently. Defrosting should be done every 3 days. These direct cooling refrigerators have more capacity than double door frost free.Must start fridge after 4 hours of delivery because the gas in compressor takes time to settle.Samsung is a very reliable and trusted company.I recommend buy for this refrigerator.

Disappointed with this model",1.0,"If you are looking for a fridge to keep food then PLEASE do not buy this fridge...This model ONLY is suitable for keeping water, juice, milk or any liquid items or some vegetables.If you keep any cooked food it will stink the next day. Beware ⚠️I have been using this for past one month and I am not able to store or keep any cooked food items in it. I called up the customer service person and he came in and told the fridge doesn't have any issues this fridge purpose is only for making liquid items like juice or milk cold  andnothing else.I was like schoked. I said this is nothing mentioned in your advertisement or manual. And he said yes the company does not detail this on their advertisements. He even said he got similar complaints from other people who brought the same model fridge.Really a bad experience from Samsung. I wonder why would Samsung build a fridge only to keep liquid items..? That's strange. Isn't it ?Another worst thing about this fridge is the small freezer box inside  the fridge frosts up heavely and I have to defrost the freezer atleast 2-3 times a week which is kind of awkward. 2-3 times a month yes practical but 12-15 times a month not at all practical.The only positive I could say regarding this fridge is that it is big and has ample space. Suitable for a family of 2or3. The second is the colour. I like the colour very much. The remaining all are its negatives. Rite now I have no idea what to do with this fridge. To be honest this has been a waste of money. The old fridge I had was much much better 😞

No complications in oparation, Hassle-free",5.0,"This fridge I have selected for 20 years long warranty from Samsung.Price I have got much lower form offline market, after RS 750 SPL discount it was payable RS 19640/-.246 litres single door, without Frost free technology it has no complicated parts, easy to maintanance.Inverter technology keeps the power consumption lower.Just plug and play. This fridge's leveling period for power consumption is 1St January 2023 to 31 Dec 2024. Manufactured on 2023.Very fast and helpful in time delivery from Amazon and good behaviour. Thanks for that.After using 30 days I am writing this review. Purchased on first week of March 2023.My family is satisfied with its parformance till now.Edit after using one year.Today, 26th of March 2024The fridge is now one year old. No problem with it, runs smoothly. Our home is near the rever Ganga and the area having moisture content in the air. It use to make defrost every 2 or 3 days. And we simply switch off from the board, we don't use it's defrost button. The water container of the back side is small in size so overflows sometime.It lowers our monthly power consumption even it runs 24x7.Thank you Samsung.

Outstanding! 10 stars. Works like magic.",5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I am allergic to pollen, pollution and dust and winters are a nightmare for me. I have tried multiple air filters, negative ion generators, personal air purifiers. I have been using PM 2.5 masks too but they suffocate me. I carry pm 2.5 meter all the time.I reluctantly used this, just to ""try one more product"". This worked wonders. My room air purifier could not get PM 2.5 level down beind 233 from 403 (Delhi, Nov 25). Using this in a 350 sq feet room in one AC and running it in fan mode got the pm 2.5 down to 45! Unbelievable. I tried for 10 days before writing this. Most importantly, my allergy and nose condition tells me how effective this is. I don't know it's life - they claim 3 months but even if this works for 2 weeks, this is outstanding.TIP: I have placed it BELOW the filter, not over it. My logic was that this should not get clogged by dust. And therefore should lead to longer life.Just run AC on fan mode even in winters and it does wonders.I purchased in Oct 2023 over Amazon.in for INR 399 per unit (containing 4 sheets). That was value for money. I am sad to see 3M has doubled the price to 775 per unit in Dec. This is OVER PRICED.

It will do the job",4.0,"This is ok for using to wash your bike or car when it's dirty. Not ideal for thick algae removal from cement floor or wall. I won't say it won't go but will take more time and water. Also am not able to use the foam spray properly whether it's the mixing problem or the machine issue i don't know in future i will figure it out. This can produce 100 bar pressure which is good for normal house needs. We can consider this like an investment because anyway we are spending a lot of money on washing stations and atleast we can reduce the number of visits. We can occasionally clean car porch, walls, etc. Hope my thoughts helps 🙂

Worst product. Not at all trust worthy",1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Item received Ist was defective one. Ordrd replacmnt. Disappointed completly with the replaced item. The package was tampered. All its safety seal were opened already. brush for cleaning the parts was missing in the pack. Switch was in on mode and hence zero battery initially. Tried charging for >4hrs. But even then indicated red light with alarm sound. When charger dock was switched off, it started to move, but showed poorest performance. Moved around hardly 5min, then became battery drained out and started alarming sound. Checked its collection box which was perfectly empty, but all dust found entagled at the brush itself. One more thing, amazon decieved me by displaying MRP 44k giving product at an offer of 82%. But the actual MRP printed on package is 27500. So for 8k, offer is only 29%. Why would amazon cheat us like this!!!

Mostly works as advertised but included dustbin (that goes into bot) has rusted spring.",4.0,"Puchased both EcoVacs T8 & Auto-Empty station from seller as combined deal and I have been using it regularly for last two weeks.Pros:Product mostly works as advertised. No issues with picking up dust, navigation or auto-emptying bin so far.Cons:1. The DEEBOT app can be improved - currently there is no way to update an existing floor map for Area mode options. If you missed a certain area/room during the initial run, then the only option is to start again with a fresh map. This doesn't make sense as I can see the map updating itself during every run and I'm able to send the robot to the updated rooms using 'Custom' region option, but when I try to use the 'Area' mode, it reverts to the original version of the map.2. Long hairs get easily get tangled up in the roller and side brushes. You'll need to use the included blade to cut and remove the tangled hair every 2 or 3 runs.3. Floor mats must be removed/moved if they are too light. The bot does recognize carpets/mats and can climb on top of them, but only if they are heavy enough to not be pushed around by the bot.I've not used the mop function yet as I bought the ILife W450 robot for dedicated mopping.Seller feedback -The auto-station came with a compatible dustbin (that goes inside the bot) but it has a rusted spring mechanism inside it. Product still works but not sure if this will be an issue in future.

Not efficient",1.0,"I have Ozmo 950 and it's good. But this model is bad. The side brushes don't even seem to properly touch the ground. The charging dock is wobbly and initially, the robo was not even getting charged. I fixed the charging dock myself. A small knife that was given with Ozmo 950, is not given with this model. I feel it is done wantedly. Without knife, it is very difficult to cut the hair and threads that get entangled around the main brush. On the whole, this is not a good purchase and i returned it. The only thing positive about this model is, it is quieter. That's it.

See through lid",4.0,"Good one if you have old mixer grinder and your chutney jar is broken. One complaint I always had was that I had to open the jar to check the grinding of chutney/masala. Not anymore with this one. Fortunate to have my wife break the blades of old chutney jar so that I get this one. Still thinking how she managed to break the old one though?Its compatible with Bajaj mixer grinder and numerous others as all the old mixer grinders have the same rotor system and cavity size. If you have the Newer ones, please check the compatibility first.After using for a year, the rubber gasket has become loose. If the chutney level (while running) is above the metallic edge, and touches the transparent lid, liquid oozes outside the jar through the lid. The lid is not tightly fitting the jar. I have always wondered which fool designed a rubber gasket with push down lid, for mixer grinder jars, where the lids have to be kept in place by hand, during mixer operation or else the liquid can explode all over. A simple twist lid (like that of a storage jar) can ensure that the lid always stay in place. Latest inverted juicer grinder jars now come with the same design but old style mixer grinders are still being manyfactured with the old style jars.

(TDS is Total Dissolved Solids)TDS... 20- 50 packaged drinking waterTDS... 50-100 RO water (recommended)TDS...100-300 water tastes sweet ( no RO is required, only UV UF water filter required)TDS...300-500 water has no  taste just neutral ( no RO is required, only UV UF water filter required)TDS...500 and above water tastes salty and its hard water (RO is required to bring down the TDS)If you are BUDGET oriented then this UV UF filter is HIGHLY recommended. The most important part in this water filter is UF filter cartridge. This UF cartridge contains small hair like strands which are about 0.001 micron thick (thickness of a hair strand is 50-60 micron)  and which filters all bacterias BUT not viruses. The viruses and the bacterias are killed or become dormant i.e the viruses can not multiply in other words they are damaged completely  by the UV lamp.In other cheap filters the UF filter is made from a tightly fitted sponge like material which does not filter bacterias but only filters suspended particles like a pre-filter cartridge. so this is the main difference between branded and other cheap filters.All branded filters are standard but KENT is reasonable and efficient and Amazon delivers with utmost care.KENT has made a name for itself since years BUT their after sales service is so costly and so inefficient, you can buy another new filter from a different branded company. Here there is a KENT dealer who sells refurbished filters and other cheap filters and if you ask for KENT he sells them at 30% more than what is available online and no free installation. you will have to pay a 200-500 rupees depending on how far is your home from their office.In my opinion you BUY from amazon and install yourself by following procedures on youtube videos or ask any plumber to install it for you for 50-100rs OR contact amazon, they will send an authorized local agent for installation without any expenses. But while the agent is installing do not allow him to open the top kent cover even if its RO installation.Thanks to amazon.

Perfect for municipal water",5.0,"The permissible Total dissolved solids(TDS) limits for safe drinking water have been described to be not more than 300mg/l or not less than 50mg/l. The recent advanced water purifiers are actually going above and beyond by putting needless purification processes which are removing the minimum tds from the water depriving them of essential nutrients. The municipal water that we get from most of the cities maintain the standards ensuring the permissible tds limits which may just require a decontamination at the most which this mission does perfectly enough. UV rays are scientifically used to get rid of all the bacterial, fungal and other pathogen infestations whcih should be enough for the water.

The cost of servicing the prefilter is 500 which can be bought from local market for 200 - 300.He also did not provide any demo as to how to use the purifier and no hard manual is present in the box.

 A very small, handy and useful product. Only thing you need is to master it by using it on regular basis. Once you master it, it's one of the best product for cooking your food when you are travelling, staying alone away from your family, secondary unit for home cooking.It's easy to clean the utensil but when it comes to the heat plate, it is quite difficult to get it cleaned properly.Time taken to prepare food?Below are some tested examples:Boiling Eggs: 5 to7 mins.Rice: 15 to 20 mins.Khichdi: 20 mins.Vegetables: 20 mins(approx)Maggi: 5 mins.Fry(Potato, Bhindi etc): 10 to 12 mins

The Little Genius",5.0,"Flawless performance.  I have been using this product for 15 days.  The hotplate remains hot when the thermostat switches the device off, so I have set the know rather low, The device comes on for a minute and goes off for a minute and a half, switching on again just when bubbling slows down - of course the cooking never stops as the heat is always present in the hotplate.  I have cooked chicken, khichdi, stew with fresh green beans and potatoes, oat, wheat, tea, boiled eggs, and of course hot water.  So easy to clean.  I use a tea-spoon to stir.  I am thinking of going in to the market to see if I can find a flat-bottom sauce-pan or similar, with a slightly thicker base.  The metal in the vessel supplied with this plate, is like an average electric kettle, and though I have not had any food burning to the bottom because I am careful, and the thermostat is set for slow cooking.  Water comes to boil in about 3 to 4 minutes and the plate is hot then.  All in all a versatile cooking product.  Plugged into the normal 5 Amp (small) socket, neither the socket, switch or the plug get even warm.

Have Been using for 1 yr",5.0,"I'm writing this review after 4-5 months of rigorous use of this product, it didn't give up even once in this time period. I specifically wanted a multicooker with removable base.. Which isn't found in the other brands,which makes it tricky to clean the vessel, and also it needs patience and caution and what not... I purchased this being skeptical to a new brand at first.. no doubt in that,  but still wanted to buy it because the design seemed very comfortable to wash properly after use.. (cuz it's removable)... which is a big deal with the other electric kettles.. Or multicooker kettles.. . Till date I have cooked the following meals and beverages with this multicooker..1. Maggi2.oats3. Pasta (ready to make)4.boiled eggs5. Chai6. Coffee7. Soups8.dalia (but it took too long to cook and got stuck at the base also)9. Boiled veggies10. Grilled sandwiches (for this i used aluminum foil - folded it 5-6 times in square, and it worked perfectly)!! But I would not recommend this as the plate gets too hot to handle properly.. So be cautious if u try this..11. Used to heat anything (almost, with the same process) like parathas, dal, noodles, pizza slices, bread, sabji, and rice.12. Paneer sabzi using ready to make gravy base.. Its really simple and so tasty.. Just grab a pack of rtm.. Mix with needed amount of water.. Heat some oil or butter in the Kettle.. Pour the gravy and cook for 4-5 minutes.. Add paneer cubes.. Cook for another 1-2 minutes.. And.. Woosh.. Its ready :) 😀😍 I'm so glad this product has been invented.. Its like a dream come true for a foodieheart like me😂😍😆😆So guys.. This was all about it. My experience with this product has been amazing, and I have ordered the same again now, as I wanted to keep one extra set for traveling purposes.Just a tip: u have to be careful while boiling milk or tea as it may splash out, and also watch for ur hands while handling the switch, it would be better if u use a small towel to prevent from burning.Thanks for reading.

Nice product.",4.0,"Bought it and using for the past two months. Its very easy to use. It works as like an Iron box(Thermostat principle).Pros:Tastes like Gas stove cooking or firewood cooking.(There's a difference in Induction cooking).Auto mode is useful to reduce power consumption.Can be used to cook Tea/coffee, Maggie, Noodles, Boiling Egg, Pea nuts, other nuts, Curry, similar items.Capacity is written in the website as 0.5 litrs. However it holds around 0.75 ltrs. (But you can use any other steel/Aluminium vessels of same bottom diameter with more height to increase/decrease the capacity)Ideal for handy/secret(In hostel, lodges, etc.,) use.Cons:Initially it takes some more time to getting heated.The vessel is very light. Some more thickness should be there.Price should be less than Rs 1000. Nothing is there to cost more than Rs 1000.Its difficult to clean the bottom. If something is spilling out, enter into bottom, then it can't be cleaned easily. Need to remove the screws and all to clean, which is quit difficult.

I would like to thank the seller for delivering my chimney on time and packing it nicely, as well as thank the installer who installed my chimney on the very next day. I would like to give a 5 star rating to this chimney and to the seller as well.

Zero quality control",3.0,"Getting a good piece, It is a lottery. The first one was extremely noisy. Waited for 4 days and raised return. The second one : bolts wouldn't fit . Terrible. So I had to send it back. The third one is fine. Good speed. Noisy only at the start. Buttons are bad: half of the time you need to pull it out, coz spring is dead.Cleaning is a pain, thanks to that ""gasket"" thing to hold the front and back cages. Should have clip mechanism.And then I bought a second one. Same brand same model. Idiot I am. This one is maha noisy & runs much slower. It is not even as good as the twenty year old Crompton all metal pedestal fan we have.It is a shame that long-timer brands like Usha find some cheap lowest price bidder to make appliances and slap their brand sticker on. Surely these would not last a 10-15-20 years.Makes me really hesitate to consider any other appliance from them. High levels of short-term-ism going on.

Excellent, must to have rechargeable Fan & Light combo!",5.0,"This rechargeable fan with bright LED light is sure one of the very handy product with nice features. Comes in a very nice packing along with support info (thanks to the seller for such a nice care to provide information cards on how to get support or service & warranty). Sleek, compact, beautiful, very light weight, tiltable, intuitive design, nice colour blend & theme, soft touch lighted & icon enabled buttons (one for two stage bright LED Light and another one for three stage speed control for Fan), has USB power (5V) input via Micro USB socket and conventional Pin type as well along with multi-state power & charge indicator. Two large rechargeable batteries are located at the bottom, which again very intuitively designed to allow easily replacement like any normal batteries. Whoever or whichever team designed this product sure needs appreciation for the thoughtful design making it as much useful and user friendly features as well.Another great feature is the USB port to charge other devices like mobile phones, comes very handy. LED light is with two stage brightness and is excellently bright enough with soft white colour. Fan speed three stage control allows it from whisper quiet soft breeze to more powerful air flow. Overall this is one of the must to have product almost everywhere right from office / work table, car and mainly kitchen (amazingly gives nice breeze without disturbing the cooking flame, bought for my wife to use it in kitchen, she loves it). Hearty thanks for such a nice and useful product!

Looks and works good but noisy",4.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 1stly an important info. After i received the product and charged it, only light was working, fan didn't. Then i read reviews and in one of them it was written that the batteries were inserted wrong. I checked in mine, it was same, batteries were wrong. I inserted them the proper way and the fan started working. The seller should mention this somewhere in the description or any other place. I thought the product was defective and already replaced it one time. This was the second time i thought it was defective, but turns out it was the batteries. Seller please provide this info otherwise most of the people are probably replacing or returning it due to the same reason.So now the proper review: The light and fan works absolutely well. The light is bright enough and since it can be moved up and down it can also be used as a study light on your table. The fan power is good. But major con it makes a lot of noise. I saw this complaint in a lot of reviews but didn't expect this much noise. It makes more and more noise as you increase the speed of the fan and it definitely cannot be used while sleeping. That is the only problem i found with this item, therefore reducing one star.

 I bought this and when it came , the fan didn't have a cover and the fan didn't work and while it was charging a flashing light was automatically appearing so i didn't like it and i got it replaced, and when the second fan arrived, the battery cover wasn't there, and when i kept it to charge the light was still flashing...and just as always the fan also wasn't working...THE MAIN REASON I BOUGHT THIS IS CUZ I WANTED A TABLE FAN! but it couldn't serve the purpose! The light worked the second time only and the fan didn't work at all . There are more faults than these in this product which would take too much space to mention!So, I recommend all of you to not buy this product.

Buyer can avail some cashback in Google Pay / Amazon Pay/ Paytm/ etc. by leaving a review and despite telling them on whatsapp not to credit the cashback on Paytm (as I do not use it/installed currently) they did it. I had clearly mentioned beforehand that they can provide the cashback to my Gpay number and I am willing to wait if they are facing some issue (they told that) in Gpay.

 The best product in Amazon, Both AC ( Direct Current) & DC(Battery current) working very Good.When ur using the Fan in Direct the current supply, the 2 batteries also charged In the same.  It's a portable Fan which is Used on the Office table or at the study table...I purchased this product for my Online Webinar programs...In the zoom conversation, I stop my ceiling fan, bcoz of too much noise in that & unable to spend some good time in that meeting...Now with the JYSUPER's - PIESOME Portable fan, No worry abt my previous Struggles. I can sit anyplace & Finish work.I am amazed, the fan batteries are also Charged by the Powerbank with 2 input pins & with the output pin USB port in the fan, a small phone can be charged.So both benefits available in one product.Fan middle LED light is very brighter ( 2 step button) & Fan wind Speed is so silent in high Speed. ( 1st & 2 nd step slight sound) , but this not an issue.I think the fan is too cost bcoz of Powerful batteries.

"Havells Instanio 3-Litre 4.5Kw Instant Water Heater (Geyser), White Blue, Wall Mounting","5.0 out of 5 stars
Serves unlimited hot water instantly",5.0,"I bought ""Havells 3lts Instant Geyser 4.5KW White/Blue"" and I'm really happy I made this decision.Let me start with why I went for ""Instant Geyser"" instead of ""Storage Geyser"".-Storage geyser's have a tank to store water and heat it.-For example a 10litre storage geyser fills up the 10 litre tank and then heats the water.-As it has to heat high volume (10 lts) of water it takes time of about 5 to 10 minutes-Instant geyser's on the other hand heat water instantly within 1 to 3 minutes-However the catch is they dont have a huge capacity tank which means at a given instant it has only small volume(depending on tank capacity) of hot waterNow who should opt for ""Instant Geyser"" and who should opt for ""Storage Geyser"" is the question ?- If you like to have a ""Shower Bath"" for which you require more than 10 litres of hot water continously then you should go for ""Storage Geyser"" since storage geyser of capacity more than 10lts will store 10lts of hot water and provide it to you as soon as you turn on the shower without any pauses-Instead if we consider ""Instant Geyser"" of 3lts capacity for shower bath, it cant provide you 10lts of hot water continously because for every 3lts it takes time to heat water again-Hence for a shower bath better to go for ""Storage Geysers""-If you like to have a ""Bathtub Bath"" then instant geyser's are good to go because-Consider using a bathtub, a bathtub generally is of capacity 350lts-If you even use a ""Storage Geyser"" of high capacity as much as 25lts, still you will have 14 pauses of 5 to 10minutes each-Because at one shot this storage geyser can provide you only 25lts of hot water continously and then you will have to wait for 5-10mins for the next 25lts to heat-So to fill the entire bath tub, you need to have 14 times 25lts of hot water = 350lts-So the total wait time would be 14 times 7mins (on an average) = 98mins-In this scenario of ""Bathtub bath"" its better to go for instant geysers since they provide hot water almost instantly and eventhough there will be pauses for every 3lts of hot water still the pauses being very small you'll have a bathtub full of water with enough amount of heat/hotnessThen you might ask what should we consider for ""Bucket Bath"" ?-Both ""Storage geysers of 15lts or above"" and ""Instant geysers of 3lts or above"" are good to go-Just choose based on:  Price,  Time taken to heat ( instant takes less time ),  Energy consumption ( instant comsumes less )Now coming to ""Havells 3lts Instan Geyser of 4.5KW"", why I bought this ?-Havells is a great brand-I wanted to have it for ""Bathtub Bath""-4.5KW heats 3lts of water in just 30 to 50secondsWhat I liked about this product:-I have been testing it from a week and it is really ossum as it is heating 3lts of water in just 45seconds ( I have used a timer to note that )-The installation was totally free, however remember you will be charged if there is any ""Plumbing Work"" do be done.-No need to buy any extra accesories like pipes, everything is provided in the box, you just need to buy a 16amp plug which would be less than 100rs-As soon as the product was delivered by amazon, I got a message from havells saying they have registered my installation request and the very next day the instalaltion was done, thanks a lot Havells ( This might differ for you based on your location, I live in hyderabad)-I really like havells customer service-The geyser comes with 2 years of warrenty for the whole and 5yrs of warrenty on the tank-It has ""Auto Cutoff"" feature to stop further heating or wastage of electricity if you forgot to switch off ( however please switch it off once done because eventhough it has auto cutoff, still once the water in the tank cools down it will again start heating and the cycle repeats )-It shows color indication: ""Blue when its heating"" and ""Orange when it has done heating"" ( Have a look at the pictures I have attached)Note:-Go for the 4.5kw model if you want hot water instantly in 30 to 50seconds, the 3kw model might take 2 to 5mins to heat 3lts of water-Make sure it is 4.5kw model because I see reviews from other customers who say the ""Mustard"" colored geyser is not 4.5kw but 3kw ( better go for white and blue color to be sure )

Not sufficient water capacity for a Bath",3.0,"Too small. I purchased for first time and thought to lut in my bathroom. It's too small! It runs out of hot water in like 20 sec. You won't be able to bath on one go. Need to fill bucket before hand manually, cos it don't hold a hot water more than 3 mugs at a time.I don't know why I purchased this. Just that also it doesn't auto switch off. It stays on even after it's finished use. Still it is working thus while. Know what you're getting it for.

V-Guard VG 50 Voltage Stabilizer for Refrigerator (Red),"5.0 out of 5 stars
As always V-Guard rocks.",5.0,"A good stabilizer from V-Guard as always. There is a ITDS or known as Time delay. Stabilizer will start according to Voltage if it's constantly 220 - 240 it will start at 2 minutes if it's below 220 or above 245 it will take 4 minutes. Don't worry that the stabilizer is damaged. V-Guard gives 5 years Warranty. It will surely last for 10 to 12 years if you are living in city there are barely some fluctuations buy this. If you are living in Village or where there is Fluctuations, spikes and many other problem buy V-Guard VG 50 Supreme. This weighs less than VG 50 Supreme. Avoid going to local brand like Everest, G-Guard 😂😂(yes there is a brand called g-guard which sells stabilizer at 500 to 900 rs warranty 0 sec)and many more even branded like Whirlpool Duro max etc. They won't give protection.

Vg 50. The best choice",5.0,"I got the product through India post registered parcel. The consignment arrived as mentioned and the packing was intact, so 5 stars for that. The package includes the stabilizer and the warranty card.The product I got was different from the picture shown in the amazon website. But anyway it was also vg 50 model. The same model is given as a separate ad in the amazon website. There is a confusion in the vg 50 model. From my side, I think it is the new model of vg 50 that v guard now produces, what we see in the picture is the old model.This model is having a constant delay and not starts instantly as mentioned by the other reviewers. This is apt for use with refrigerators upto 300 litres.This model have a three pin outlet at the backside and supports whirlpool three pin plugs no issues as others have mentioned. Whirlpool 245 l model.

As long as they are working fine, it is brilliant. Issue starts when you have any issue or any part damaged. The customer service is so pathetic and very very slow. No point in having a great product and service being so worst. It feels like a lottery now. It works as long as it does ( depends on your luck) and if it has an issues, then you are stuck. If you have issue after 3 months, then its a waste of money. So buy it at the risk of taking that chance.

But once I received this product, I was totally disappointed, as I couldn't even use this even once. 1) The diameter of the suction / blower end is not matching with the diameter of the vacuum pipe provided. Its unbelievable that quality check was not performed for my product. 2) Hose pipe was missing in the pack. I wonder why this is not been checked, even few of the customers have raised the same kind of concern in the reviews. Plastic quality of the pipe / connectors are not so good. Apart from this, I'm unable to comment other features / issues, as I haven't switched on the Vacuum cleaner. I have raised for re-placement. I hope, I will get a decent one, next time. For the first time, I return a product with issues in amazon. Very disappointed. @ Seller / manufacturer: kindly take this concerns / issues in right sense and try to provide good quality products and service to the customer. I purchased this based on the good ratings provided earlier by the consumers. Now, I wonder, how disappointing this is. @Amazon / Seller : Kindly take this feedback seriously. Thanks

The included user manual provides clear instructions, making it a hassle-free experience for all.Energy Efficiency: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)While the OTG Oven delivers exceptional cooking results, it's worth noting that it might consume slightly more energy than smaller toaster ovens. However, its performance and versatility more than make up for this minor drawback.

Only when you put the maximum temperature then only the rods will lighten up otherwise you dont see the top and the bottom rods lightening up. Not sure, if this is the reason why dishes take more time to cook then usual.

Disappointing Quality and Performance of the Mixer Grinder",1.0,"The finishing quality of this mixer grinder is very poor. There are unusual gaps in the panels, and the plastic quality is subpar. The product looks different in reality compared to the pictures. The blender jar is the worst part as it sometimes leaks from the lid. The grinder jar fails to make smooth shakes, leaving chunks of fruit even when run at high speeds. I would recommend avoiding this product.

This small and portable device makes frothy and delicious milk foam for your favorite drinks, like lattes, cappuccinos, and hot chocolate.One of the most notable features of this milk frother is its powerful motor, which allows for the creation of a thick and creamy foam in a matter of seconds. It's also incredibly simple to use, with a one-button operation that anyone can learn. Another great thing about this frother is its compact size and portability. It's ideal for taking on the go or for use in small kitchens where space is limited. And when you're finished, it's simple to clean with a quick rinse under the faucet.

Great product and even better service from Amazon",5.0,"Amazon's delivery and customer service is super efficient. Got the product 10 days before the estimated date. It is a very sophisticated looking product. Works extremely well. Let me just down a few pros and cons -Pros1) very good looks2) does not make any noise (nose of the fan is there but it's minimal and non-obtrusive)3) has coasters... So you can move it around easily4) good swing and now functions5)has a remote,  so you don't have to get up from your bed to switch off or reduce speed6)hardly consumed any electricity7) does not increase humidity or spray water or create any discomfort in hyderabad climate8)good cooling function9) you can use it as a fan during summersCons1) consumes lot of water... 31 liters week go empty if you run it for 10-12 hrs non stop2) the horizontal seeing swivel just hands down. You will have to prop it up by lifting it and keeping something before it for support.3) the power cord is not very long... So you will have to keep it very close to the plug point. I recommend buying a extension cord if you really want to move this around at your homeOverall a very nice functional elegant product you will  be proud to show off. It does what it is designed to do and did it well. Trust me guys, this is more than enough to beat the summer heat. Don't waste money on air conditioners of you stay in any of the dry cities in India like hyderabad or Delhi, Gurgaon, noida, Ahmedabad, jaipur etc.

Works fine as long as it does (one month in my case) - No hope for servicing it after that",1.0,"My initial experience with this product was not bad. There was some initial mystery around the tentative date of delivery, but after a few days of placing the order I was provided with a delivery date and the product was delivered accordingly. It also provided great relief from the unnaturally hot summer that we experienced in Bangalore this year, and while it doesn't cool the entire room, as long as you're in the line of the draft you will feel much needed respite from the heat. I thought i'd use it for a while before writing a review, and I'm glad I waited. About a month after I acquired this cooler, it stopped cooling. On examination, I observed that the valve through which water is pumped from the storage to the water tray was not working, as a result of which water was not flowing onto the cooling pads -> thus no cooling. My cooler is still under warranty so I raised a complaint on the Symphony Website ('Log a Service Call'). I receive a message from them that my request has been assigned to a maintenance engineer, but I do not hear from him for over two weeks. Then I receive a text message saying that since they were 'unable to reach me for three days' they were closing my request and I'd have to raise a fresh one. This was mighty strange since my phone had been reachable throughout the course of those three days, and I did not have any missed calls. So i raised another service request on the website and also complained about the unfair closure of my first complaint. I immediately received a call from the customer care apologising for the trouble and assuring me that a maintenance engineer would attend to my problem. Meanwhile, I received an SMS with the number of the maintenance engineer and a note that he would get in touch with me. Learning from my experience, I called him instead - he seemed very prompt and promised to come home the next day to fix the problem. Now, I am a working person and I live by myself so I got permission to work from home the next day so that this could be attended to - but after promising that he was coming/ on his way etc. for most part of the day, there was no sign of the engineer making a physical appearance. He promised to come the next day (today) - so again, I waited at home. In the morning when I spoke to him he said another maintenance engineer had been assigned the job and was on his way to my place. Many calls later and long story short, its 8.30 PM and no sign of the engineer. Point being, if you are spending 10,000 rupees on an air cooler that works for a month, and you do not even get remotely decent customer service after that (they expect you to sit at home all day for days at a stretch waiting for their mechanic who is 'on the way') - you'd rather place a tub of ice under the fan and get through the summer..UPDATE:My efforts to get the cooler serviced continued for the next 4 months at the least, and i sent innumerable messages and lodged innumerable complaints, but absolutely no response from Symphony - and no sign of any repair engineer. Don't waste your money.

 It's for two or three peoples.Great product with a small issue there is no ice dispenser. Still my favourite one because I'm using it 24*7. And I didn't faced any difficulty in using this.Great chilled air.Noise level:- Not that noise is coming from this cooler. Even I'm taking meeting while sitting in front of this so noise is not that much high.Remote control: Remote is very use full and a long useable range.Portability: In terms of portability It is very much portable because it has wheel. I can move it to any of my rooms easily. And you can also lift it easily because it is very light waiting.Water overload hole is also there for safety.Loved it!!

There is an auto cook menu for that and all it does is just to heat up the milk to the temperature required for making curd. Rest everything have to be taken care by us like keeping the milk in a closed dark place undisturbed etc. this could be done on stove and you won’t need microwave for that.All in all very good purchase and I’m very happy about it.

Average",3.0,"I am a Samsung customer for washing machine. Earlier I had 6.5kg top load automatic washing machine which worked fine with one motor replacement in 13 years.So I bought this one considering my past experience and 20yrs warranty on motor only.But sadly the machine is avg.Points why I rate it average bcoz1- Drying is pretty bad unlike my previous one which dried clothes properly. Drying is bad due to the low rotation of motor.2-The amount of time cycle program are unecessarily kept long. Like earlier my samsung washing machine used to take 3 cycles of water and wash it within 50-55mins. Now the same thing takes 1:13 hrs.The only positive side is 20 yrs motor warranty. Like u can use the machine till 20yrs. From the past experience I can say only 2 issues arise one is of the motor and second is of the panel.So if ur looking to buy it for drying don't go for it. But if u want a long warranty for motor to save money and have ample sunlight to soak clothes as drying is bad then go for it. Those who don't have sunlight coming in their houses for drying clothes don't go for it.

The best friend to the working people out there",5.0,"I must say that I am honestly very surprised to see the functioning of this product. It works wonders. It’s what everyone in their busy lives need to keep their homes tidy (more so if you have a pet). I have a pet dog & we would always find his hair on the floor. No amount of brooming / mopping has been a solution. Then came robotic vacuum cleaners to the rescue!About the product :It is very easy to install on your own. It would take 40-50 mins on the very first run to figure out the boundaries. Later on it takes around 30 mins for a 2 BHK. I make it a point to keep the floor as empty as possible for the robot to cover as much area as possible.The laser guided technology works really well. It easily vacuums over carpets. The map management features to add restricted areas work really well (the robot once entered our washrooms when we left the door open, added those as restricted areas & never faced trouble again). Easy to clean, easy to operate at the click of a button, once the base map is configured it works even if there’s no power & it has battery. Every morning, I move things out of its way, turn it on & leave it to work its magic.Note :My feedback is based on 1.5 months of everyday usage. I do not use the mopping functionality (I tried once & it does light, okaying  mopping)

Product worked only for 1 year, worst customer support",1.0,"Bought Viome SE in Aug 2022, as a product it worked well, within 11 months the battery backup became very poor, it could clean only a 10x10 room in single charge then it didn’t have charge to go to the charging unit as well.As it was under warranty they sent a new battery, fixed it and it worked well for another 2 months.Then suddenly the unit stopped responding, the power and home button lights kept blinking no matter what key was pressed or not pressed, it was not even getting detected on the app.Then the ordial of customer support started, contacted them multiple times, I followed all the steps suggested, explained to multiple people about the situation, got into a video call and did everything which was asked, they told they will get back and it’s more than a month now and got message that I can take it their service centre…After the interaction I understood that people in customer support are not technically qualified, engaging with them is wasting our time, they don’t understand the problem and just give a scripted reply.I will not suggest this brand to anyone and I myself have decided to buy a new Robo vacuum cleaner which has better customer support system in place.

Do not buy this model - very poor quality couplers and bad design!",1.0,"The coupler crumbled (literally!) within a couple of weeks of usage. We didn't realize it until the return window was over as we presumed that the problem was with the jar.We were quite happy with it's performance and ease of use while it worked! Within 2 weeks the grinder attachment stopped working - the blades would rotate freely when rotated manually but would not engage when connected to the base. The blender attachment continued to work (which actually made us think the problem was with the grinder attachment) for about another week or so before it too had the same problem. So, we assumed that it was the jars that were wearing out so fast. We thought of looking for a service centre or just buying a new jar for the mixer-grinder but the nearest service centre to us is 134 km away - in Chennai (we live in Pondicherry). We were not able to call the stores either - number not in service or when it rings no one picks up the phone.Incidentally, while attemptimg to use it once more, I started suspecting that the problem may be in the coupler of the base and tried to see if something of off with it. Lo and behold, white powdery flakes of plastic started coming of the coupler when I used my fingernail to try and clean it. I understood that the blades of the coupler which should lock on to the coupler in the jar had got crushed either by starting to spin while the jar was not yet fully locked or continuing to spin while the jars were being unlocked (more likely).So, only one star for the product (as I can't give a lower rating) - do not buy this model at all!!

Best part is, so much easy cleaning. Spillover is not there, since the cooking vessel sits over the outer body support. Outer body in red is good hard metal and not plastic. The packing was so thick and very professional to protect edges. Delivered exactly on time too. Just go for it!

This product has been delivered to me with good packaging. All parts are in good condition",3.0,"This product has been delivered to me with good packaging. All parts are in good condition.About cooking rice: Please read the user manual thoroughly before using it. This is essential. Here, I'm talking about of my first time usage. So, I cooked 3 cups of raw rice (the measuring cup provided with it) and 9 cups of water(the same cup). It took 45 minutes,plus extra 15 mins.(this is in ""warm"" mode after cooking) An hour is, I think,a little long time for the process. And another thing is, I had to check continuously,if the water is coming outside or not. Probably, a cup less water will work next time.The cooked rice was soft and good. But, I think if you use an open pan, the cooking time is same. The plus point here is you do not have to strain the excess water.Well, it is easy to use. You can use it for a neat cooking.

The water tastes great, and the peace of mind knowing it's purified is priceless.The purifier uses a 5-stage process, including RO and UF, which makes a noticeable difference in water quality. I especially like the Copper+Zinc+Minerals feature that not only purifies but also adds essential minerals back into the water.I am mainly using it for Tanker and Municipal water and it also adjusts the TDS (which I have learnt from the forum and other reviews).

Hamilton mixer grinder",5.0,"Overall and great buy.Manual and preset settings are very user friendly.Preset function is great and worked well beyond expectations.Very easy to use and does the job in a few seconds with excellent results.The built quality is exceptional and very high quality, the steel, polymers and gaskets used feel very high quality and durable.Its quite easy to clean .Some have mentioned that the motor is very loud, its a 1400 watt motor and that will definitely sound a tad bit on the higher side, but it still has that robust high quality sound to it . not considerably high..IMHOAesthetically appealing and well thought of design.(quality engineering)Quite stable and hands free operation.Motor coupler are steel.Try watching how to videos before using this product, Just been a few days using it but seems like a robustly engineered product. Time will tell.And yes a 5 year warranty is provided, again time will tell how good that is.Overall pretty satisfied with the product, will certainly update my review incase I come across any.The price was a factor and that was a reason I waited for quite a while to purchase this product, bought this at a steep price of 20 k, However when I first browsed for this mixer grinder it was around 24 k ish.Sadly I returned the first one, as I thought the display was not functioning right , reason there was a sticker and it somehow looked similar to the actual display (I have a really bad eye sight :-( and returned the product :-( When the second one arrived I noticed the same issue and finally realise that there was a sticker on the display that has to be peeled of ( sorry seller)Last but not least the safety feature's provided are a great addition to the overall package.I am actually very happy with the build quality, engineering, aesthetics and overall performance. Its money well spent,and was a gift for my Wife.

Cheap alternative for heavy metal stand",3.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I was fed with changing my washing machine stand twice due to corrosion as we live near to coast. Also it was difficult to drain the water as the metal stand edge doesn't allow to open the machine drain port fully. As a result the room is full of water and extra job of mopping. This one looked the best alternative for me and pocket friendly. It fits the machine legs perfectly and sturdy - no shaking while spining. Easy for to drain nw with just a stray beneath. Earlier I always use to find rust powder and dirt accumulation between stand and machine but now it's clean. Though it has few disadvantage- cannot move the machine easily as wheeled metal stand (so fixed in one spot), height I felt too low making it difficult for daily cleaning(mop won't go under it).

We get jet/spray option with a simple twist which is very useful and helps in removing every single particle of dust etc struck under body or near tyres.

No light sensor for sleep mode, slow updates of air quality, but satisfying air circulation",4.0,"I have bought air purifiers from 3 brands. Philips, Dupoint (Trusens), and Honeywell.Philips AC1211/20 doesn't have numerical pm 2.5 display. It just changes colour based on air quality. It's quiet when it doesn't have to increase the rate, but noisy in turbo mode. But the advantage is that it has a light sensor. It automatically switches off the lights when it senses that the room is dark. It turns very quiet too.But this one doesn't have a light sensor. If you don't like the lights, you have to manually switch it off.Trusens is even worse though it costs thrice as much. Honeywell i5 and Philips both turn on automatically after a power outage. But trusens doesn't.The lowest fan speeds in honeywell is greater than that in Philips. So it consumes more electricity for sure. Philips and Trusens just increase the air circulation only when needed.Now about the filter.This one has a real prefilter that can be removed and washed. In Philips, the filter is one unit and the prefilter is attached to the hepa filter. And in Trusens you have to replace the carbon filter once in 2-3 months even in a relatively good environment.Philips comes with an anti-allergy mode. You just need to keep the auto-mode on.So basically if you need high fan speeds and a numerical value for pm 2.5, then you can go for this. The removable, washable prefilter is also a plus.For practical purposes, better automatic function, quiet and low light/light off sleep, go for Philips.And under no circumstances would I recommend truesens, that purchase is one of my greatest regrets.Tl;drPros:1. Turns on automatically after a power outage and resumes function2. PM 2.5 numerical values displayed3. Even the lowest setting of fan speed has quite a good air flow/circulation4. Removable and Washable prefilter that is not part of the HEPA/Carbon filter making it easier to clean.Cons:1. No light sensor. You need to turn off the lights manually (but it doesn't really cause much trouble even if those tiny lights are on).2. Very heavy. It's much heavier than the purifiers that I have, though the CADR value is lower than those. And there are no wheels. So it's not very portable.3. The fan noise is audible even at the lowest speeds.4. The display takes a long time to update the PM 2.5 values. Don't know if it's the sensor that's faulty, but when you first switch it on after moving to another room, it might take upto 5 minutes to show the reading.5. No response from the seller for queries on issues faced.I have only had to replace my filter once for my Philips AC1211/20 after 3 years of purchase.It never had any problem.Trusens made me replace the carbon filter within 6 months and it gave the warning for another replacement in 3 months. I live in a relatively good environment, so I think it has some issue.I shall update my review on this unit (Honeywell i5) as well.Hope this helps.

Honeywell Air Touch HCMF25M0012 Compound Filter with HEPA and Activated Carbon (Black),"5.0 out of 5 stars
Amazing product on price",5.0,"I had considered other purifiers but when I saw reviews I decided to give this a try , this is where it helps make us customers make informed decision thanks to all reviewers out here ....Now for the pros and cons :-PROS :-1. Recognised brand Honeywell is a global company with some amazing products so too quality2. Design of the purifier is very simple & elegant3. Touch sensitive buttons are nice edition4. Its innovative design allows to suck it maximum air through its vents5. The filters are easy to install and clean6. The mash net comes with a plastic cover remove it before using , its cleans the larger dust particles & very easy to clean with a dry cloth7. The Hepa filter is the heart of its process fine silicon honey cones on one side and activated Carbon  on the other , its solid build8. Using it for over one month no problems yet9. The Air quality senser is very accurate it detects pollutants easily than adjusts fan speed accordingly on Auto modeCONS :-1. Since it sucks air from alot of directions it tends to get dirty with dust in alot of places aside from filters like on top , area between filters & even fan so cleaning needed2. As with all air purifiers its suction is not very powerful if u have alot of furniture in your room chances are it will only do a small area3. Its placement is key to getting optimal air quality4. The Hepa filter is of high quality but so is the price so long run might not be economical5. On maximum speed its very noisy so I put it on manual speed only6. If u look at the machine its just a fan & filter nothing innovative just milking the market because there is a demand , so years down better products will come or improve7. The life of the filters depends on pollutant levels of the environment so one month on my machine its working fine it might be different for othersI have shared some pictures hope they help

Unbelievable performance and quality",1.0,"I can't believe a product can be so good it fails in 4 months and get serviced within 1 month. It works for 15 days and fails again. They take 3.5 months to repair second time.In between I enjoyed calling Honeywell people, service people 100s of times. They are so polite in answering the calls.Also I mailed them a number of times and my emailng skills improved in the meantime.Again I created a new ticket for service . Hope they will repair it within a year.I also thank Amazon for selling such a wonderful masterpiece in their platform.

One of the convenient product in todays modern life",5.0,"Be it boiling water for your little one, washing baby utensils with warm water or warming water to use in cooking. Any and everything can be easily done which reduces the burden of putting water on gas/stove and switching it on, the traditional way. My take is as below:Pros:- easy to use/handle- compact- auto power cut based on the water level you take- warms quickly- the product is made of good quality material (both inside and outside)Cons:- the wire length is too short (2 and half feet)- sediments settle after few times of boiling (shown in the one image) - water quality can also be a reason, even though we use only purified water to boil.Cleaning the sediments is easy, steel scrubber without any soap or detergent. The only things is that you need to clean it regularly so that the composite does not keep settling which makes cleaning difficult.We liked the product and the use it has, so 5 star from us.

Worth It!",5.0,"My mum was already using this for more than a year .... so I decided to go with Pigeon over other brands. I checked few other options but was strapped for time too and this was up for one-day delivery. So I decided to go for this .. as I was comfortable having tried it at my mum's.It's a simple and straight-forward design .. nothing fancy ... looks good though and does the job. Heats up water real quick ... can heat up more than a litre in one go, or just a cup for a quick glass of hot water. The auto-shut off function is good and an ideal safety feature considering we might forget when multitasking.Have been using this for a while now, regularly and happy with this purchase! Go for it!

DO NOT BUY: This is a made in China cheap quality Iron box",1.0,"I bought this substandard Iron box on 25 Aug, 2022. When I chose Wipro, I thought this is a good quality product and it may be a Made in India product, but it is Made in China cheap quality Iron box.I had faced many issues with this product during the last one year.1.Faced Water leakage issues a few times while ironing.2.Iron box wire length is not sufficient for comfortable ironing. As the entire product is substandard one, the quality of wire is also bad.3.Wipro Consumer Care & Lighting Customer Support experience:The customer care service is also very pathetic. We need to dial multiple times to get a chance to speak to a customer care executive and there are no speedy solutionsI contacted customer care to report this issue because this product has  2 years warranty as per Amazon. But when I contacted customer care, they stated initially that the warranty is only one year by default. Then I explained that this product is purchased from Amazon and in the invoice, it is mentioned that this product has a 2 years warranty. After a small argument, the executive had agreed that he will report this to the backend office and they will contact you in  few days.As I did not receive any response from the customer care even on the 6th working day after I reported this issue ,I contacted the customer care again on the 6th day. I had requested them to give a clarification on this product  warranty period first because it's been 1 years and 15 days since I purchased it. If the warranty is only 1 year, I can get this issue fixed outside without Wipro Support.I could not come to a conclusion if the warranty is 1 year or 2 years even after I contacted customer care two times.Every time the customer care executive had told that you will receive a call and  product pickup will be scheduled soon. I did multiple follow up calls to customer care and wasted altogether  more an hour and I decided  to repair it outside finally as I cannot wait for more than 10 days.I received a call from Wipro customer care on 18th day for product pick up. I am located at the heart of Bangalore and they took 18 days just for schedule a product pick up for repair.Better to go with other brands, Wipro needs improvement in this product and their after sales services.

 The top of the filter is open and a lot of water just gushed down to the next container when I poured water over it. The design is different from the original filter (it has a cover on the top). Plus the notch that connect the hole with the other container is loose. I paid so much and got something that is not worth. Better buy from the shop.

Do not buy",1.0,"Do not buy this grinder because it doesn't grind anything well. No matter what you grind, small pieces are left, whether it's a soft fruit like banana or hard one like coconut! Ok, at first they didn't even respond to my complaint by email. So, I tweeted and they were apologetic and sent a tech. Guess what the tech said? This is how it grinds! That there will always be little pieces left! He took pictures and said he will show his supervisor. Next day I received an sms stating my case was resolved and closed! grrrrrrr! I contacted them by twitter and those guys said the same thing!In short, DO NOT BUY! This will NOT grind! I am complaining to Amazon that I want my money back!

Faulty design of jars and lids",3.0,"I have ordered and received Bajaj Twister Deluxe 750-Watt, well in time. I had a Bajaj of an earlier model. Since the utensils and the covers have become old, I had decided to replace it. Bajaj has a good motor and works well. However, I find their design of the jars always faulty. The locking of the jar and the lid is always sloppy. This time, I had observed the small jar, has a lid which is designed well. It helps to grip the lid, press it down and open it. Whereas the other two jars have rounded domes are not easy to grip and open. You have to use another gadget to help it release and open. I was in two minds about returning the grinder, but often find that you have to go through a lot of hassle and also lose time and money. Moral of the story - please always buy all appliances by going to a shop not online. The answers to your parameters of assessment of a gadget as a person who uses it regularly, are not available on these sites. Hope this will be helpful.

Very nice product i have ever bought from amazon.The jars i received makes my work very easy in slicing and grinding, best brand and best product.But, last month my juicer broken because i accidentally slipped it from my hand and the outer plastic got broken.

Good Machine but expected better material quality.",4.0,"Being Phillips fan, ( Philips trimmer purchased earlier is working great even after a year of use. I am using it for hair cut ) I ordered this and delivered within a week. I ordered multiple items regularly from amazon earlier but First time I received outer Amazon cartoon damaged. And the reason is outer cartoon is double size of that of Phillips box which leaves lots of empty space in the cartoon which causes damage to the cartoon during transportation.Phillips box is intact. Received all the items unbroken.Quality of material - I have used 2 Phillips food processors earlier in Dubai. Comparatively quality of plastic in this food processor is cheap. ( I didn't expect that from Phillips at this price range) Sharp edges inside one of the lid. Handle quality of chef jar looks ordinary. Locking of lid is not so smooth.Noise level - Noise level is bit on higher side but bearable considering it's 750 Watts machine.Power - it's motor is powerful and 750 Watts are enough to perform most of the operations smoothly.Atta kneading - that's the main purpose of buying this machine and I think it performs well. Atta kneading took just less than 2 minutes. It works really fast.. This is first day review. I will update this review time to time to give you clear idea about this machine.Update 24/08/21 :I found it difficult to remove the additional motor provided for main chef's jar from base unit. In other model which I have used earlier, this motor was attached to the main jar and it was non removable and also waterproof. But in this model we cannot wash that motor part and it's really very difficult to remove from base unit.Phillips should consider this point and provide additional small handle type part to the motor with which it will be easy to rotate that motor easily. Or some lock should be provided to the motor and main jarEdit 07 March 23 : -almost after 2 years.Earlier I talked about problem in removing additional motor provided for main chef's jar. So I booked complaint with Philips and they send the technician immediately. After inspection he said that he will replace the motor. But he didn't have that motor with him so he told that he will bring it later. But then I received a sms from Philips that my complaint is attended and problem is resolved. So I again book a new complaint with Philips. This time technician brings a new motor and replaced it. This motor was also little difficult to remove but better than the first one so we kept it.We are using this food processor regularly and it's still working good. Jars are still in good condition. ( I thought the atta kneading jar will not lasts longer but I was wrong. It's still working good.)Wife used juicer jar to extract fruit juice and it works good.So overall a good product.

Very useful little appliance (superpower - kneading atta)",5.0,"Very useful product, for a household of 2.Kneading Atta is super easy.Chopping methi, and kneaded Methi Parantha Atta, with just a blade change.Was even able to knead leftover cooked dal ka atta for parantha, súper duper easyGrinding coconut chutney using the bigger wet grinding jar. Making tomato paste for curries in smaller jar, smooth. Haven't used the bigger jar for grinding idli batter.Making banana smoothie, apple smoothie, easy, haven't used the citrus attachment yet.Overall, really enjoying the usefulness of this applianceSound is slightly on the higher side, but doesn't bother me, hardly for few secondsOnly drawback, the gearbox usage needs a demo or instructions illustration in the booklet. The food processor jar comes attached to the gearbox out of the box. Even the booklet does not tell how to separate. And I felt scared to twist wrong and break it. Was not able to separate the gearbox from food processor jar and had to wash it with the gearbox attached.TIP:  place the gearbox attached food processor jar on the body. Then turn clockwise to lock. To unlock, twist counter clockwise ONCE (this will unlock the gear box from the motor) NOW, twist more - counter clockwise - making it TWICE. This step will unlock the jar from the gearbox.Overall: very useful and highly functioning productOrder 2nd SeptemberDelivery 5th September

Not Worth Buying",1.0,"Bought this model on 3rd March 2024 and 14th may 2024, the blender jar is already damaged. It was damaged while the blender was in use. Such poor quality plastic and nothing is covered under warranty. Wothun 2 months, I am now paying another 1000 to buy a new jar. Not at all a sturdy model. For a food processor it should have good quality jars and blades as wel, Philips miserably fails with this model. It is noisy. The main body has vacuum  stickons which are supposed to keep the mixer in place during blending. But in heavy blending like juice/ daal batter, you have to hold the mixer or else it will start moving over the counter top.Do not buy at all.

Really Quality Product",4.0,"Bought@209/- in March 2021. Using it since. Happy with the product. Plastic is of good quality. Accurate capacities. I've checked them with medical scoops and 5ml droppers. Cups & spoons have two capacities more each which turned out to be of immense help.Colour is nice.But the product has two minor issues one of which I've dealt with my own way. I've cut off the flat top portion of the set which has given awesome flexibility in use. And the other problem is, the capacities written on the handles of the cups and spoons are nearly unnoticeable. Any person with weak eyesight will have a hard time to read them correctly. So, the ease of use is somewhat hampered. And so, deducted one star.

Breeze instead of the wind turbulence",5.0,"We use it also as a fan on our living room in addition to it being an air purifier. The advantages we see are1. It's very compact which means the real estate space needed for it even with the rotation is very small.2. The air flow feels like a breeze rather than the turbulent wind of a fan. Ideal for a city like Bangalore where a slight breeze is all you need.3. The noise has improved even further compared to the previous model of purecool.4. The formaldehyde filter is a life time filter.PS: The other filters other than the formaldehyde filters needs to be replaced based on usage.

This is an air purifier, not a fan",3.0,"I purchased this product primarily as a fan with air purification. However, this cannot be termed as a fan by any stretch of imagination. The air is so feeble that if you are at a distance beyond 3-4 feet, you will not even feel it. They should just drop the word ""cool"" from the product name, as it misleads buyers into thinking that it is also a great fan. You will be much better off buying regular fans. Also in a place like Bangalore, where the air quality is already good, I am not sure how much of a difference does it make to the air quality. It generally shows air quality between 25-50 PM2.5.At this point, the product looks great in the hall, but that is about it. Also cannot return it as it is non-returnable. Please do your research and evaluate your need before making this purchase.

Worst product and worst coustomer care service",1.0,"Flying insects started coming inside the fridge after just 2months of usage. We lodged complaint and their technician came to look into the issue. He came and cleaned the fridge, broke the freezer door and didn't even show the manners to fix the door ,he asked us to buy a new door or fix the door with glue . Apart from this he charged us an amount for cleaning for which no receipt was issued. Again the insects started coming inside the fridge next day. From there we have registered atleast 5 complaints for the same issue. The customer service center in Bangalore is the worst. Each time the same technician came and he asked us to clean the fridge daily. We even tried that, though it sounds nonsense. But the issue is not resolved. They are not able to find the root cause of the issue, they are not able to give us a solution and they are not ready to replace the product though it is still in its warranty period. They told us they can't replace the fridge for such silly reasons. As if the insects falling in your food is not a serious issue at all and you still can eat your food eventhough it has dead instects in it. In the last call today , they asked us not to keep vegetables/food in the fridge , as if we have purchased the fridge just to keep it in a corner as a showpiece!!!

Exceptional Brew with INALSA Espresso/Cappuccino Coffee Maker",5.0,"The INALSA Espresso/Cappuccino 4Cup Coffee Maker 800W- Bonjour has truly elevated my coffee experience. This machine is a must-have for any coffee lover.The first thing that strikes you about this coffee maker is its sleek and stylish design. It’s compact, making it a perfect fit for my kitchen counter without taking up too much space.The machine is incredibly user-friendly. The controls are intuitive and easy to use, even for a novice like me. It allows me to make espresso and cappuccino with just the touch of a button.The quality of the coffee it brews is outstanding. The espresso is rich and full-bodied, while the cappuccino is creamy and frothy, just the way I like it. The machine’s 800W power ensures that the coffee is brewed quickly, which is great for those busy mornings.One of the features I appreciate the most is its 4-cup capacity. It’s perfect for when I have guests over or when I need that extra caffeine boost.

Terrible quality! Zero stars should be a thing.",1.0,"Let me start by saying that I never write negative reviews... but this machine is just terrible. Truly the worst. Keep as far away from it as you can. Where to begin:1) The steamer only provides enough steam and heat to warm the milk of 1 small tea cup before it just sprays out water and dilutes the milk.2) The dripper splutters and sprays coffee everywhere creating a big mess. Big cup, small cup... doesn't matter.3) Build quality is pretty bad, it definitely is not a long lasting machine. Particularly the portafilter (handle thing you put the coffee in). It feels like it will break just putting it in the machine.4) The machine requires you to use a single or double insert for the portafilter. This means that the portafilter can't be ""banged"" on the edge of a coffee bin to clean it - as the insert just shoots out.I used this machine just once, then tried to return it to Amazon. After about 10-15 converstaions - each one requiring me to explain and re-explain my issues - I then had a visit from a ""technician"" who admitted to me that he had never seen a coffee machine before and didn't know how it was supposed to work. He took some videos, sent them to INALSA and they said ""your machine is fine"" and refused the return. Some of the staff were polite but others were just rude - passive aggressive and arrogant.I feel completely ripped off by INALSA. So disappointed.I think I should make a video to show the world just how trashy this machine is.AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS.Please INALSA train your staff better and work at making better quality products.

Good coffee maker",4.0,"Initially received a damaged product with a hole on the top.  Seemed to be used as well.Amazon replaced the product without hassles and the replaced product was in good shape.Now coming to the coffee maker, it's pretty light in weight. Doesn't leak from anywhere. The steam pressure isn't very good as far as making the coffee is concerned. Pressure is enough for milk frother though.Due to low pressure of the steam don't expect high strength espresso shots with crema, it isn't capable of that. What it's capable of is making really good filter coffee. If you're used to a drip machine then this appliance will perform much better since it extracts the coffee atleast 3x better than a drip machine.It's not for coffee connesenuers but then again no coffee connesenuer is going to buy a machine worth 4k.For the average person who just wants his coffee quick and easy without over analysing it it's a really good machineAdditional comments:Add water to the machine and put the dial to ""pause"" postion. At that position it will continue to heat the water and create pressure. Only after about 3 minutes put it to the ""coffee"" position to start making your coffee. If you start straight away with the ""coffee"" position then the water would not be hot enough to make a good cup.For the first time users, you need to practice with the frother. If you dip it in the milk/coffee too much then it won't produce froth and will just heat the milk with steam. If you don't dip it enough then you're gonna spray hot droplets on your hands. I got used to it within 2 uses.I will update this review if I face any issues

Initially, I felt it might be a problem but after so many years  of use, I don't feel/see any difference.On and on a good product to have in the kitchen IF you have a big family (4+) & frequently make the above items at your place. Mine came without a lid [at that time it wasn't in offering anyway] & I had a hard time looking for a fit. I finally bought one after much looking around on Amazon site itself but it still is not a perfect fit. It leaves the edges open. But I make do with it. Something is better than nothing. I had a plate at home which was too snug fit. Found it difficult to lift it when it came time to turn over the chillas/pancakes/dosa. Now the models that are coming with lids which is much better.

But it seems to be too large to sit on the hob being 31 cms. But having said that, the partitions for the dosas seem to be ok, howeverI.am finding it hard to get a suitable lid to cover it.

a money worth product no more car wash from third parties you can top wash yourself.",5.0,"The resQtech PW 101 is the starting model but the pressure is high enough and very easy to assemble and use it comes with 2 nozzles and one 90 degree angle nozzle for undercarriage cleaning and also one patio cleaner you can clean your tiles easily with it very fun to use patio cleaner.The PW 101 dosent heat that much but it heats a little bit and when i firstly started using it i smelled something like something was burning inside pressure washer but i have been using it for months now so no problem till now.About Power its 1700W so i use it with power socket not normal socket keep that in mind.And the hose pipe is 6M in Length pretty long enough to cover all sides of your car if not long long you can get the extension pipe from RESQTECH it self then your hose pipe will be 13M longAnd one disadvantage is only that the noise is a little bit high so keep that mind sometimes it can distrub your neighbours.Well this is not the technical review you were looking for its an honest review of overall product as i dont too much technical details but this is all from my side 💯.

Happy with the product",5.0,"Good fit for my old Seimens iQ100 Front load 5.5kg. Quality also seems to be good. It is waterproof but micro textured finish tends to retain water on surface for slightly longer, the smooth plastic material would let the water slide away easily. That’s said it’s not a bad solution to protect your machine from water at all. Would recommend it for its good quality and right fit
