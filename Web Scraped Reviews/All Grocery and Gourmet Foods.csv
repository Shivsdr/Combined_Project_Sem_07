Elevate Your Culinary Experience",5.0,"Urban Platter Pink Himalayan Rock Salt Powder is a game-changer in my kitchen, elevating both the flavor of my dishes and my overall cooking experience.First and foremost, the quality of this salt is exceptional. Sourced from the pristine foothills of the Himalayas, it's free from additives and undergoes minimal processing, ensuring that it retains all the natural minerals and nutrients that make Himalayan salt so prized. The fine powder form makes it incredibly versatile, allowing for easy incorporation into a wide range of recipes.One of the standout features of this salt is its distinct flavor profile. Unlike regular table salt, which can often taste overly salty or harsh, Urban Platter's Pink Himalayan Rock Salt has a subtle, nuanced flavor that enhances the taste of food without overpowering it. I've found that it adds a depth of flavor to everything from savory dishes like grilled meats and salads to sweet treats like chocolate chip cookies and caramel sauces.Furthermore, the pink hue of the salt adds a touch of elegance to my culinary creations, making them visually appealing as well as delicious. Whether sprinkled over a fresh salad or used to rim a cocktail glass, it adds a pop of color that instantly elevates the presentation.In addition to its culinary uses, I've also incorporated this salt into my wellness routine. Dissolved in warm water, it makes a soothing and invigorating bath soak, helping to relax muscles and detoxify the body.Overall, Urban Platter Pink Himalayan Rock Salt Powder has become a staple in my kitchen and wellness regimen. With its exceptional quality, versatile nature, and unique flavor profile, it has truly transformed the way I cook and enjoy food. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to take their culinary creations to the next level.

Nice",4.0,"The atta purchased was nice at the price but the only drawback was that the atta was hard. And it made it difficult to make rotis out of that. Even after the rotis were baked the chapatis became hard and it was not so plesant eating those. Apart from this the atta was neat and clean as well as cheap in comparison of other non gluten attas.

Firstly, the packaging is very convenient and easy to open. The 420 gm pack is perfect for sharing with friends or family. The noodles cooked quickly and had a nice texture. They were not too soft or too chewy, just perfect. The curry flavor was rich and authentic, with a good balance of spices. It had a nice kick of heat without being too overpowering.Pros: DeliciousTake 3‚Äì4 minutes to cookLong and soft noodlesSpicy and tangy tasteCons: The pack only comes with a seasoning powder and not a separate oil sachet like other brands.

Unique texture & flavour but too sweet.",4.0,"These Lotus Biscoff cookies are alright. They've got that unique caramelized flavor, which is cool. They're also non-GMO and vegan, which is a plus for some folks. However, I found them a tad too sweet for my liking, and they can be a bit crumbly, you can also taste the flavour of ghee in it . The 250g pack is a decent size for snacking. If you're into sweet treats, these might be your thing, but they weren't a huge hit for me due to the pricing it's very expensive,In terms of taste they are good.(Got it for Rs250)Alternative for the same is UNIBIC BISCOTT,They lack the texture which is the signature of BISCOFF and also the have the overpowering of cinnamon flavour.- UNIBIC price is Rs120 for 250gm and in Dmart you can get it for Rs60.Thank me later ;)

VALUE FOR MONEY üí∞- 3.5* ,  Received Bhujia Sev Instead of Noodles,Must Read.",3.0,"Hi guys, Today i am going to share my Complete Honest Opinion after eating 2 packets out of 3.First of all I  wasn't knowing that Top Ramen Launched Bhijiya sev Noodles. Lets Begin the detailed Review :-5* out of 5 for Spicy ( Really Hot) ‚ù§Ô∏è4* out of 5 for Quality of Noodles . üëçüëç3.5* out of 5 for Taste Maker . ( SPICY Level won my heart, but not in taste wise.,it was like eating Chilly flakes/ powder.1* out of 5 for Packaging. üëéüëé ( 3 packets were Totally Crushed)VALUE FOR MONEY üí∞ 3.5 *.. i Genuinely Loved it. But as a Noodles Lover, I like the shape should be like Noodles not Like BHUJIYA.================MY Opinion :================PRODUCT wise this Noodles won my Heart. People Those who are looking for extra Spice believe me this product is for you.I ordered  3 packets , None of them was in better Condition. Although the outer box was completely okey.There is no Fault of Delivery Guys, it was completely Packed with wrappers properly. I think The seller is selling the Damaged or crushed Products.Everything is perfect here, But  maggie's Taste maker is having  better taste than this. I wish they should improve in taste wise especially in Taste maker. Spicy level is perfect but Little bit Improvement require in terms of Taste. It was like Eating Chilly Flakes/ powder.As per Single / Bachelor it will be too hard to guess  how much you want to take because of its Bhijiya structure. I was confused how many Taste maker packets i will use for the amount because I can't Eat whole 4 at  once.This Noddles is Quality is one of the best in terms of spiciness.Although its giving a tough Competition with Haldiram and Kurkure in terms of BHUJIYA SEV. Even  with Bikaniri Bhujiya also.üòÇüòÇ.==================My Recommendation :===================I personally Loved it as per taste but i will recommend  only to those who Love Spicy.If you are a spicy Lover with extra heat , This product is for You . Go for it. Undoubtedly Best.If you really don't like Chilly , Please skip this.This Bhujiya Noodles  will Stand out to be 4*  if it will be in Noodles form.  Or ELSE it will be 3*.I am going to order Again after Completion, Lets hope i will not Receive this Bhujiya Noodles again.Thanks For reading My Review. Have a Happy and Safe day ahead. Jai üáÆüá≥.

Watery and doesn't justify price",1.0,"I recently purchased this DIABIC-CARE juice  and was extremely disappointed with the product. The juice was much too thin and had a watery consistency that did not resemble juice at all. For the price I paid, I expected a quality juice, but this did not justify even 50% of its cost. It lacked the thick rich texture and full flavor that a good juice should have. I would not recommend this product to anyone and will certainly not be buying it again.

Elevate Your Culinary Experience",5.0,"Urban Platter Pink Himalayan Rock Salt Powder is a game-changer in my kitchen, elevating both the flavor of my dishes and my overall cooking experience.First and foremost, the quality of this salt is exceptional. Sourced from the pristine foothills of the Himalayas, it's free from additives and undergoes minimal processing, ensuring that it retains all the natural minerals and nutrients that make Himalayan salt so prized. The fine powder form makes it incredibly versatile, allowing for easy incorporation into a wide range of recipes.One of the standout features of this salt is its distinct flavor profile. Unlike regular table salt, which can often taste overly salty or harsh, Urban Platter's Pink Himalayan Rock Salt has a subtle, nuanced flavor that enhances the taste of food without overpowering it. I've found that it adds a depth of flavor to everything from savory dishes like grilled meats and salads to sweet treats like chocolate chip cookies and caramel sauces.Furthermore, the pink hue of the salt adds a touch of elegance to my culinary creations, making them visually appealing as well as delicious. Whether sprinkled over a fresh salad or used to rim a cocktail glass, it adds a pop of color that instantly elevates the presentation.In addition to its culinary uses, I've also incorporated this salt into my wellness routine. Dissolved in warm water, it makes a soothing and invigorating bath soak, helping to relax muscles and detoxify the body.Overall, Urban Platter Pink Himalayan Rock Salt Powder has become a staple in my kitchen and wellness regimen. With its exceptional quality, versatile nature, and unique flavor profile, it has truly transformed the way I cook and enjoy food. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to take their culinary creations to the next level.

PILGRIM Korean 5% Vitamin C Face Serum (Oil Based) for glowing skin with Hyaluronic acid | Vitamin c serum for radiant ski...,"4.0 out of 5 stars
Detailed review",4.0,"I am not a big fan of vitamin c serums/ lotions / moisturizers/ toners because My skin is very sensitive to citrus products in any form when applied topically e.g. appearance of redness accompanied by temporary baby bumps on face‚Ä¶or itchiness ..etc‚Ä¶ . So basically vitamin c almost has never been a part of my skin routine ever.  That being said ,I believe  it‚Äôs good to incorporate vitamin c in one‚Äôs skin care .I came across this product thru IG where it was a vit c combined with almond oil , Hyaluronic acid ,olive oil, Camille and while lotus extract .. I instantly bought it off amazon because the composition of the serum is oil based off ingredients that can calm your agitated skin ( for me it‚Äôs vitamin c that makes my skin agitated).Cons :1) it does not have a citrusy fragrance that is a trademark of vitamin c in most products . So if you are looking for pure vitamin c. This is not it .2) this should not be part of summer skin care routine or for oily skin.3) whether it helps in discoloration .. it‚Äôs too soon to comment . Normally for any serum to be effective one has to be patient for 4 weeks at the most .4) I won‚Äôt call it serum : it oil based vitamin c.Serums are light weight and have high absorption because al the ingredients are super volatile and used in extract form. I wish pilgrim had made the consistency a little less dense basically using almond , olive  in extract form instead of oils because even though it‚Äôs instructed to be used in your pm skin care routine .. the serum does not get absorbed by the skin quickly and  and my skin looks oily even in the morning even though so I squeeze a only drop or two before bedtime right after toner.Pros1)No more agitated skin for me :)2) it keeps my skin soft and supple even after the fact I forget adding a moisturizer after face wash .3) you do not need to apply  almond oil or olive oil separately on face as it‚Äôs already in there4 ) a little goes all the way .. so good value for price . Ps. - do not drip serums on face like influencers .. it‚Äôs sheer wastage of product5) skin calming  ingredients for sensitive skin4) soothing smellBaseline :Go for this product only if you want to include hydration in your winter regimeGo for this product only if your skin becomes agitated after applying vitaminGo for this product if you have never applied vitamin c and want to give a tryGo for this product only if you have a super chapped  dry skin that needs intense hydrationGo for this product as a step to prime your skin in way advance if you are going for a  matt finished look.Go for this product if you are running under a budge cut just want one product to do all the job of hydration, clear pigmentation and nourishment to skin within 800 bucksIf you do not have any of the criterias I would recommend go for cruelty free Korean products- klairs , cosrx , Tony molly ,

Amazing Product..Don't Miss buying it!",5.0,"I purchased this item solely on word of mouth and it didn't fail to disappoint. I have dry skin and I have been looking for something similar besides the regular moisturizers. I started seeing results after just few days. The dark spots on my face started reducing and my skin started feeling hydrated. Make sure you apply this religiously every night before you sleep and massage your face for few minutes. The fragrance too is very nice.I now swear by this particular serum and since it was good I am going to try other products from this brand.Worth the price!

Great for Dry Skin, Not recommended for Oily Skin",3.0,"I do like this brand . But I feel this product is more targeted for Dry Skin as compared to my Oily/Combination Skin.Pros:--It does contain a decent amount of Vit C, but toactually see some effect , it might take a few weeks so be patient.-Hyaluronic Acid is a great ingredient , but be sure you are using it when your skin is moist , or has some toner on, otherwise being a humectant it might absord water from your skin making it too dry.Cons:--Even though I don't have active acne , I did not like how it didn't absorb that well and left an oily layer. Usually serums take their time but get absorbed.-The smell! It has more oils than other ingredients IMO, even though they've not mentioned the percentage, the overall consistency is oily and so is the smell. That being said it did not cause any breakouts.

HEAVY OIL BASED SERUM",2.0,"Let me start off by saying this is NOT a serum. The first 2 ingredients on the bottle are almond and olive oil which makes this product oil based and heavy, and not light as a serum should be (In the cosmetics industry, ingredients are always listed in order of prominence. This means that the ingredients follow an order of highest percentage to lowest percentage) It takes a lot of rubbing into the skin to soak in and it feels like a layer on your skin. The product is heavily scented which is another thing you should beware of in your skin care. Not sure I will continue using the product.

If your expectations are to the level of Brooke bond Taj, then please don't purchase this tea as you won't be happy. However if you like simple good tasting tea, then go for it. I have purchased some real bad tasting teas in the past, which after one try, l had to end up gifting it to my housemaid to use it.

Delicious + an excellent substitute for cheese in pasta!",5.0,"This product makes your pasta creamier and richer‚Äînot to mention more chees-ey. Thing is, you can (of course) achieve the same results by melting actual cheese‚Äîideally a mix of a couple of types you like best‚Äîbut that makes the pasta that much heavier, which some people might not like.

I never expected this from Flyberry. Someone has removed dates while packing for sure. The upper carton was intact which means mischief has been done at the time of dispatch.  Dates are undoubtedly of good quality but how can Flyberry do this with a permanent customer? I don't know from where to order dates now.

Hair strand found",2.0,"Pros :The quantity is good.It comes in two pouches if 900g bought so that you can store and use.It's good when mixed with milk.Cons:Very disappointed when found a hair strand in the pack.It's not easy to spread on bread.Too much sugar you'll feel like biting the sugar crystals.Moreover I have bought 900g but didn't receive the jar, it was in two pouches. The packaging was not good.On the pack it was written Rs.50 will be offered if 5 star rating is given so most of the reviews are just for this offer.I won't buy from this brand again.

It might affect your sleep.Verdict:Buy this coffee during some good deals or pantry sale.

Irresistibly Crunchy and Flavorful: Happilo Premium Roasted & Salted Pistachios Review",5.0,"The Happilo Premium Californian Roasted & Salted Pistachios have quickly become my go-to snack for satisfying cravings and indulging in a healthy treat. Packed with flavor and crunch, these pistachios are a true delight for the taste buds.First and foremost, let's talk about the quality. Each pistachio in this value pack is of exceptional quality, with a perfect balance of freshness, crunch, and flavor. Sourced from California, these pistachios are roasted to perfection and lightly salted, enhancing their natural taste without overpowering it.One of the standout features of these pistachios is their irresistible crunch. Whether you're enjoying them as a midday snack, adding them to your favorite recipes, or sprinkling them over salads or desserts, you'll love the satisfying crunch that these pistachios provide. It's the perfect way to satisfy hunger and keep cravings at bay.I also appreciate the convenience of the packaging. The resealable bag ensures that the pistachios stay fresh and crunchy for longer, allowing you to enjoy them at your own pace without worrying about them going stale. Plus, the 500g value pack size is perfect for households or individuals who love to snack on pistachios regularly.In terms of taste, these pistachios are simply divine. The roasting process brings out their natural sweetness and nutty flavor, while the light sprinkling of salt adds a perfect savory balance. Whether you're enjoying them on their own or incorporating them into your cooking, you'll love the delicious taste and texture of these pistachios.Last but not least, let's talk about the health benefits. Pistachios are packed with nutrients like protein, fiber, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals, making them a nutritious addition to any diet. They're also cholesterol-free and low in saturated fat, making them a heart-healthy snack option.Overall, I highly recommend Happilo Premium Californian Roasted & Salted Pistachios to anyone who appreciates high-quality, delicious nuts. Whether you're snacking on them straight out of the pack, incorporating them into your cooking, or using them to make homemade trail mix or desserts, you'll love the freshness, flavor, and quality of these pistachios.

I have fresh pomegranate juice regularly and this is nothing like real juice.This juice company is a scam, going through loop hole marketing to promote the sale of liquid to people who think that they are drinking healthy juice. This product is a money making scam. This is the scamming of the modern times. I would not buy again.

I have been using this regularly and 1-2 times a day as a daily routine and it works well. During extreme rash, application helps a lot and with 1-2 usage the rash reduces immediately. Do not spend too much on expensive and unnecessary rash cream, this is one of the easiest available rash cream and worth the price.

Okay product",3.0,"Not at all bitter (may be dutch processed); has artificial chocolate flavour added into it - that means its certainly not the best quality product in the market.Update: Flavour is very weak. I have a suspicion that this cocoa powder is adulterated with starch and artificial color. This is not the first time I bought Weikfield cocoa. It used to be way bitter earlier, but now they must have changed the product. Will be trying out Hershey next time.Update 2: I have switched to Hershey for now, the advantage gained from higher price of hershey is better flavour, less/no impurities. There are significant batch variations in Hershey's flavour. So even with Hershey, I got unlucky at times. The best solution would be buying callebaut cocoa powder (belgian product), downside being it only comes in 1kg pack, costing about Rs. 1600.

The range of pulses offered by Vedaka is extensive, including various lentils, beans, and legumes, all of which are sourced from trusted farmers. The pulses are well-packaged in sturdy and resealable bags that keep them fresh for a long time. I appreciate that they are sorted and cleaned, making them easy to cook without any impurities. The taste and texture of the cooked pulses are excellent, and they cook evenly, saving me time in the kitchen. The competitive pricing of Vedaka Pulses is also a huge plus, making them an affordable option for everyday use. As a budget-conscious consumer, I find Amazon Brand - Vedaka Pulses to be a reliable and economical choice for my pantry, and I highly recommend them for anyone looking for high-quality and affordable pulses.

The Indian Chai - Organic Chamomile Tea (1.75oz/ 50 Gm) | Certified Organic - Detox Tea - Calming Tisane - Herbal Tea - Ca...,"5.0 out of 5 stars
Highly aromatic and simply awesome!",5.0,"My quest to find the best Chamomile tea led me here as it is my favourite bedtime tea (well, sometimes it is Lavender). Having tried many brands before I had huge expectations and pleased to report, this one surpassed all my expectations!One of the reasons I gravitated towards this brand‚Äôs Chamomile flowers is because it had the Organic stamp and I had had a few of their tea blends which really impressed me.Thanks to the excellent packing, the Chamomile flowers weren‚Äôt flattened or in indiscriminate pieces.  You open the seal and the floral fragrance of Chamomile hits you strongly. And the golden yellow colour woos you visually. If you generally like Chamomile, you‚Äôll love this one!For a first timer, do bear in mind that Chamomile tea does not have any taste per se. Since it is a floral infusion, it relies more on smell. Also there is no ‚Äútea‚Äù here. It contains only Organic Chamomile flowers so if you make a tea out of it, it is basically a herbal infusion (tisane) that you're drinking.The tea is deep yellow in colour (more amber in the first steep) and I found it highly aromatic with the slightest suggestion of sweetness. However, my mum found it slightly bitter so I guess it differs from person to person.I let it steep for 5 mins the first time and found it to be rather strong. A 4 min steep would be ideal and yes, you can steep it the second time too! My third steep turned out to be too light so according to me, 2 times would be perfect with the first one being 3-4 mins and second 7-8.The tea is in a resealable air tight zip paper bag which means you can zip lock it and retain the freshness.Looking at the shipping cost, I was initially hesitant of ordering but after calculation I found the total cost to be less or on par with the others! And more importantly, the flowers are not mixed with tea of any kind nor are they second rate tea bags. This is pure and organic loose Chamomile flowers. Also, often when you order loose Chamomile, a lot of it is powdery but thankfully, the bulk of the flowers retain their structure here. As a result, nothing escapes the tea strainer. That‚Äôs a huge plus for me!And yes, I was pleasantly surprised to find a generous sample of ‚ÄòBelly soothing green tea‚Äô along with this order! The seller sure knows how to delight his customers!

Must try it",5.0,"Of all the herbal teas I have tried till now I think this is the one i liked the most, and i have tried so many of them ( all of them are from Indian Chai). And ironically chamomile tea was the first herbal tea of any kind i have ever bought.It comes in a  container which is just perfect because i couldn‚Äôt have asked for better than this , only thing i am a bit disappointed about is that it‚Äôs a plastic container ( not quite environment friendly) .Tea itself is amazing,basically it's just chamomile flower and smells exactly like that ‚Äò‚Äôflowerly‚Äô‚Äô.It has a very  mild taste which you would notice only if you add too much of it,otherwise it‚Äôs just boiled water with flowerly scent.It supposedly has various health benefits ,although i can‚Äôt say about them all but it does help with bloating and perhaps helps with better sleep ( I am not sure though) . i personally drink it every night before going to bed ,it has quite become a habit and I actually crave for it.Lastly coming to the price , it would be great if the brand can bring down the price a little but personally i think i will buy it again even if they don‚Äôt because 50gm has lasted me for about 2 months ( please consider the fact that in my family only i drink this tea that‚Äôs the reason it has lasted me this long).I would recommend you to buy this tea and see for yourself the benefits it has to offer.

The prodcut solved the purpose alright however, the flowers were a bit too dry and hence had probably lost most of its essence by the time the final product reaches the customer.

Slighly Damaged, but otherwise alright.",4.0,"Packaging:The package was plastic, with a metallic lid. The lid wasn't installed properly so it was slightly open on the side. Ripping of the metal lid was a bit hard so instead I opted to just cut it off with scissors. Also I recommend storing it in a different container, since it don't trust the packaging to be air tight.Tea:The tea has good flavour and good scent, tho the scent isn't that strong. The buds are quite small at about 2-5mm, so I use about 3-5 buds to brew tea.

Only con was it was a little messy to feed but then you can't expect a 8 month old to be able to suck cleanly. Fortunately I had a big burp towel and was able to catch most spills and messes. Keep a wet wipe to clean up after. I like the fact that they rely on mixing the fruit and vegetables in such a way that the puree ends up being sweet instead of relying on added sugars. Any child that loves sweeter fruits will love this.

The taste and smell is exactly as toasted sesame oil I wanted",5.0,"Hi,I bought this product a while back and have been using it since few months and finally decided to write a review after multiple usages...The oil has an exact aroma that I was used to when I was outside India and cooked Chinese meals...Was looking for something similar in India and I am so glad I bought this. It adds the right nutty flavor to my rolls, noodles and stir fries and I will definitely be buying more. I see they have added delivery charges, which I think wasn't the case earlier. I hope they remove it by the time I need the 2nd batch!... Thank you for great quality... The little bottle lasts me for quite a while since I use it to cook only gourmet Chinese entrees.

Watery and doesn't justify price",1.0,"I recently purchased this DIABIC-CARE juice  and was extremely disappointed with the product. The juice was much too thin and had a watery consistency that did not resemble juice at all. For the price I paid, I expected a quality juice, but this did not justify even 50% of its cost. It lacked the thick rich texture and full flavor that a good juice should have. I would not recommend this product to anyone and will certainly not be buying it again.

Good product, cannot serve for 2 per sachet.

Matched the expectations",5.0,"My expectations were high when I decided to try this tea. I had already looked through other products being offered on the website. Some I had already tried but wasn't happy for one reason or another. Other's weren't compelling enough.This was a well priced product while also being compelling.Tea was clean , not at all dusty.Leaves unfurl very well and didn't left residue in water once I was done brewing.Flavour is pretty much what one expects from a green tea but even if you over brew it , the taste barely gets any bitter. Can be brewed twice.Taste sits well with additions such as lemon and honey.Packaging was good and portion also feels genuine to the price. Plus the wooden spoon was a welcoming addition.Will buy again.

It adds the right nutty flavor to my rolls, noodles and stir fries and I will definitely be buying more. I see they have added delivery charges, which I think wasn't the case earlier. I hope they remove it by the time I need the 2nd batch!... Thank you for great quality... The little bottle lasts me for quite a while since I use it to cook only gourmet Chinese entrees.

Genuince, authentic Kashmir Saffron",5.0,"I was a bit unsure about how genuine saffron sold in India would be, but this product is the real deal. This is how I checked:1. Saffron should smeel sweet, like honey2. The taste, however, should NOT be sweet - it should be slightly bitter3. The colour of the strands should be a deep red4. When you drop some strands of saffron in water and wait a few minutes, it should start to colour the water yellow, not red. The longer you leave the saffron in the water, the darker the colour gets, but its always yellow, never red (if its red it means an artifical dye has been used)5. Even after hours of of leaving the strands in water, they still remain red. I kept them for a whole day, and they still remained red. Its only after 2 days that they started losing a bit of colour - but not completely.6. After a full day of soaking in water, the strands are still strong. They do not disintegrate if you pick them up and rub them on your fingers.7. Just 4 or 5 strands are enough to give a litre of water a nice yellow colour like a sherbet!The product passed all of these tests. Very happy, and shall buy again. I also noticed that there were no yellow strands in the bottle. As saffron is so expensive, some companies mix a few yellow strands with the red ones, because even a few yellow strands in each bottle can make them a lot of extra money. The yellow strands, while part of the same flowers, are not kesar.Go ahead and buy without hesitation. This is the real deal.

Drop the isotretinoin. Use this for acne",5.0,"Ive been suffering for acne for quite some time. Thing is ive been on accutane twice, so acne comes and goes. But accutane left me with deep scars that i nevr had pre-accutane, so i dont wanna go for a third one, been looking for an alternative and stumbled upon some vid on youtube claiming B5 does what accutane minus all the side effects.THINGS TO KNOW (might work differently for different ppl but this is what i observed on myself)1.  My acne got really bad in the first two weeks and then from end of third week forward it became better n better. So patience is the key here.2. Do not take biotin related products along or after this medication. I ran out of supply during the nationwide lockdown in Match so i decided to take Bitotin along with other vitamins but Little did i know bioton reduces vitamin b5 level and mayne thats why(?) my acne came back. Again im speaking for myself only but biotin completely negated whatever benefits i got from b5 so unless u know bition works for you might wanna steer clear of biotin which is widely raved in the market for its skin and hair benefits.3. Expect notable difference from 1.5 month onwards and really good results 2 months after useFor those interested, i took 3 pills after meal morning and evening. I lowered to 2 pills each after 2 months. Will probably reduce to 1 in a few. See what works for you, make sure not to take too much in one go, patience is the key

Product. If you show that image to the customers officially and encourage them to buy this product then you have to be commited as per the ""Business Ethics"" to provide them ""COMPLETE  PRODUCT"". In my box,quantity indicator cap is missing.It is very important to make specific proportation of Juice to Water like 10:90 , 20:80 , 30:70 . You must have to ENSURE that dispatched product is COMPLETE as per the PRODUCT IMAGE shown at the site of 'Amazon.in'. Otherwise, you don't have any right to claim that ""We are commited to providing each customer with the highest standard of customer service"". If you are not able to follow ""BUSINESS DISCIPLINE"" then you have to change current product image from Amazon.in .But,it is the sign of losers.

I use this chilli oil+Keya peri peri masala as a dip for flatbreads, cheese, khakhra, steamed sweet potatoes, momos etc. Homemade roasted makhana, popcorn, potato fries/wedges coated in a dressing made of this oil+salt+spice/herb powders are some of my favourite go-to snacks. I also use it for baking crackers and frying spicy papdi, nippattu, murukku etc. This oil is an all-rounder, it packs a big punch, and I am thankful that it exists.

Healthy & wholesome meal for kids",5.0,"An amazing & healthy product for the moms conscious about their infant's diet.

An interesting fact for those who want not to add refined sugar in to their kid's bowl that it has no artificial sweetner rather sweetened with dates & if you want, you can add jaggery, dates sugar or coconut sugar while cooking the porridge. You can also be creative by adding some chopped nuts  while serving if your little one is comfortable enough to have it !
